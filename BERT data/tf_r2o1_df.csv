this cover is made for the kindle dx and fits it beautifully the problem  and its a big one  is if you accidentlly try to open the cover from the back which is very easy to do you can damage the kindle without even realizing whats happened my husband did this and cracked the kindle frame within the first week of owning the device fortunately only the frame was cracked and the kindle still works we cannot however remove the cover because of the way it hooks into the device the hook closure must be bent because of the accidental attempt to open the back cover after the incident we attempted to clip the back cover to the kindle but found this to be cumbersome and the clip would not stay in place we are just extremely careful now but the damage was done almost immediately i hope this design flaw has been fixed,1.0,negative

the kids were loving these as christmas gifts but here we are  months later and the battery charging port barely even works we have to hold the charging cable at a certain angle for it to even charge i wasnt expecting a super long life out of these tablets at  a pop but shouldve lasted longer than  months very upset with  sad kiddos,1.0,negative
amazon is at the forefront of k content offering several shows in hdr then why isnt their very own streaming player capable of displaying it and at only  fps to boot this was obviously built to a price but if youve already shelled out the money for a k tv wouldnt you want it to be able to display all that its capable of the roku is at present the far superior product,1.0,negative
i would give it zero stars if possible every single battery came dead every single one completely useless and a waste of time to try and fight for a refund usually i have great faith in amazonbasics but now im not so sure,1.0,negative
worst batteries i ever bought less than one hour after installing in remote popup on tv said remote battery low left them in and got about four hours more use before it wouldnt turn on the receiver the aas i bought seem to be fine not sure why the aaas didnt last put  new ones in the remote  well see how these do the second set of four were no better than the first low battery warning after a few hours use surfing dish tv program guide all showed just over  volts before installation checked again when first low battery warning came up down to  volts guess i got an old bad batch nothing but duracell from here on out would not recommend these batteries ,1.0,negative

i picked up this tablet thinking it would be a great buy i have a few family members that own the previous model of the kindle fire and highly approve of them the new product i got was very disappointing the display had a dead pixel on it when i turned it on the product is very slow and the cameras leave a lot to be desired i took it back and exchanged for an ipad mini  and am very happy with it,1.0,negative
i was excited about the amazon echo however after getting it home setting it up and finding out how limiting it is that excitement went away fast the echo couldnt answer the majority of questions or would be asked a question and instead of answering it would play country music which i never asked forunless you have smart home features like a smart thermostat or smart lights etc it is useless aside from being a speaker which for the money it isnt a good speakeri did however try it for a week finding it not worth it or that googling questions was easier to answer even asking it about what movies were near me etc was a pain some said maybe i got a defective unit which wasnt the case the echo is just limited in what it can doi would say save your money this isnt worth it yet,1.0,negative
horrible do not buyi bought these in aa and aaa and they all lasted just a few days my battery tester shows them on the lower side of good when unused but doesnt take long before they stop working,1.0,negative
i have never been so disappointed with a product the battery life is horrible when used in my camera i can get maybe five standardnon zoom pictures before the camera shuts down and states the batteries need replaced when used in tv remotes the battery life is maybe a week it is the same with the amazon aaa batteries too i will not be repurchasing again,1.0,negative
the last  models of kindle hdx  have been terrible we have purchased  of each model of kindle and up until the last  models they have been great last years had to be replaced  or  times and for the same problem the slot for the sd card is defective i gave up and bought the newest model it shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason its going back after the first of the year this is going to be my last year for kindles unless they make them the same quality as before phooey,1.0,negative

bestbuy came through before the holiday better than amazonitem available arrived within  days competitively priced great service there my problem is with disappointing performance by echo siri wins over alexa issues encountered a skill will be installed but alexa will tell me first i need to install the skill and second that the skill is already installed user is stuck in a doloop with no response access to quick sentence read from wikipedia is appreciated but if you ask tell me more alexas voice is so rushed and computerized some of the information is unintelligible tons of skills but so many of them are at a micro level and others are time gimmicks if you are not careful you then need a skill to help you with all the skills youve installed responses on some of the more interesting skills are just plain wrong vocabulary on word master is limited so you will told your response is not a word that begins with x and we have had instances where our correct response on jeopardy is reported as not correct in one skill about a magic door  a clue is described but when selected you are sent backward a step with the same clue offered again frustrating and makes you feel you are doing something wrong or not speaking clearly children can get frustrated quickly access to music is quirky some pieces by classical composers will play only a few minutes of a selection abruptly stop and begin a new piece but some singers and ambient pieces will play for hourspositives flash briefing weather word definitions pandora access timer,1.0,negative

i purchased the amazon fire tv after owning the roku  for a year and after trying both the older and the newest versions and apple tv i am a prime member so this seemed like a perfect choice however the remote is very unresponsive disconnecting more than it stays connected the menu layout is very adcentric and pushes you towards how amazon wants you to view their service when the remote works the amazon tv seems sluggish in comparison to the other products i tried after several hours of fighting with the remote i decided to return it and get another rokupossibly the version  good try amazon but far from being close to either roku or apple tv,1.0,negative
i bought this for my  year old so she would have another option for watching her shows besides my ipad needless to say she was too frustrated with the slowness to load the netflix app and it would only get internet if you were in the same room as the modem you really do get what you pay for if you buy this dont count on getting online very seamlessly the internet browser is really slow to use but you can get around this by downloading google play store to access the firefox app which is not offered on the amazon app store check youtube for instructions,1.0,negative
all i can say as soon as i opened this tablet it never ever turned on i was so upset as ive followed the troubleshooting steps from other users online and still it never worked i fully charged the tablet and tried again and still it never turned on i had a very hard time at the best buy returning this item had to spend an hour and explained the situation to them they never believed me this item came to be defective after storming out and after a while they have decided to accept the return and gave me credit for iti would never buy an amazon product ever again piece of junk bad quality productthanks,1.0,negative
i as well as other kindle lovers have noticed that although we have taken great care with the cover it has warped and has bubbles and is not durable within  months and i only started using the kindle with the cover in the past  weeks noticed the cover has become warped and bubbled under the leather no idea what would cause this i have taken great care not to put it near any source that would have done this damage not sunlight heat moisture or anything i will be requesting a replacement but kindle manufacturers of the cover need to do their homework and come up with a better product especially for the price we paid,1.0,negative
bought these for my kids for the holidays no you tube app installed so you have to find a rd party substitute ads pop up all the time with an option to remove them for  amazon states that since i purchased the tablet on sale for  this is how they can afford to compensate for that revenue i would have returned them had we been able to find the receiptmaybe a good product but not for us,1.0,negative
i didnt like it from the begining because it isnt very ergomatic it was easy to hit the wrong button shocking your dog when it was last set to vibrate it was veru easy to push buttuns so you cant put it in a pocket then a week into use while replacing a probe i hand turned to tighten it and the prope broke with the scew end broke off level and no way to get it out i bought a product that had a different control style so many manufators use the same controler design and i hsve no problems with handling this one another problem is that the reciever can be shook off the collar the more it is worn we lost the reciever after a few weeks it might be ok if your dog is a fast learner and plan to use it for just a few days,1.0,negative
i had an old ipad and when it quit i decided to go for the amazon fire tabletreally only used it to play games and for entertainmenti hate itbattery life is very short i pretty much need to keep it plugged in at all times and it freezes and just shuts out of screens i cant take it anymore and am now going to buy another ipaddont waste your money on this i am very unimpressed with this product and amazon in general now,1.0,negative
i like these batteries but a couple of times now after putting them in i have opened up the compartments to find battery acid leaking out inside i figured it was just a one off but it has now happened several times i am reluctant to use them anymore in case i damage items,1.0,negative
i have had this product less than  months it shut down unexpectedly and would not restart i contacted amazon and the only help they could give was to hold the power button for  seconds and when that did not work i was told to buy a new one quality of a product is measured in warranty and support this product comes with very little warranty,1.0,negative
one of the important reasons i purchased this was for hbo go app which they have but does not work with chartercomcast a quite large market of people affected so a useless claim they readily put out there that you can play it what else can you not use it for i havent found yet but amazon has not written me back after i emailed them about this issue im stuck with waste of money and will go get a google chrome now,1.0,negative
i baught  for my kids and figured that with the cover the the one year of freetime which includes all the videos apps and games then it makes sense i baught this one as a gift for a kid overseas and all the content is not playing when i contacted amazon they said its not for overseas although i asked in best buy before i buy it and they assured me it works everywhere its totally overpriced for a tablet that doesnt play anything best buy should know and let customers know specially when u ask specifically,1.0,negative
just got this as a christmas gift and it doesnt stand nothing to secure it to make it stand you can get it to stand maybe to watch a video but dont touch it it will fall down easily certainly dont stand it and actually use your fire hd with this cover you cant falls right over i feel really badly for the special person that bought me this waste of money i had already bought my own cover for a lot cheaper that has more shock protection and that one wont stand on end but at sits securely at a tilt which makes it more useful for me the cheaper one i bought on amazon also has a magnetic closer to the cover stays closed this one does not not sure how to tell the person who bought me this that i dont like this one at all ill feel bad telling them and theyll feel bad hearing it bad all around,1.0,negative
the batteries are the very worst i have ever used i use a wireless mouse for work and ive had to replace the battery every  weeks instead of once a year like my old batteries by the time you figure out how bad they are you will be outside your return window a fail for amazon if you ask me and makes me question whether i should keep shopping with them,1.0,negative
this item is the worst ever a d the tech support is even worst spent hour troubleshooting and their solution was to return it to bestbuy a d get anotherone so i did and guess what it didnt work ether basically the netflix app cant be downloaded becuse the amazon fire tv wont let you and to make it worst if youre a fan of hbo brace yourself becuase the app isnt even available on their app store hbo simply doesnt exist i spent in total  days troubleshooting with the amazon team actually managing the fire tv remotely from their offices and the answer was that ether the equipment is defective or that they dont have netflix or hbo available for it really its freaking advertised on the box dont waist your money better get an apple tv or a roku,1.0,negative
i bought this and the kids version past christmas its lack power and storage to be useful unless you want to just read books dont waste money on this product the kids version is a good ideal but loading the apps when they work takes forever when they do work the kids enjoy them so i consider it to be a hit and miss ill be canceling the subscription as soon as my free year is up not wasting money on it,1.0,negative
this kindle is so overloaded with apps that i will never use despite what one of best buys associates said you cannot remove any of the amazon apps the apps take up too much of the memory i have an i pad and love but bought this as a backup for work unfortunately it bogs down i also dont like that amazon wants access to too much info to set up email so i wont use this for emails either i will likely sell it on craigs list for less than half of what i paid for it,1.0,negative
i bought this as a birthday gift a few weeks before the party when it was removed from package and turned on the image was cracked like the screen was broken but screen was not broken best buy washed their hands of it and said to call amazon i did and had to go through over a weeks worth of calling them to get it replaced best buy lost me as a customer over this if you buy this from them make them open it before you pay to verify it works,1.0,negative
used it for  days and the screen froze  timesthe kindle just wont switch on had to restart each time and sometimes restarting wont help it is clearly defective brought it to a bestbuy store to exchange but custumer service wont replace it asked me to look on the kindle shelf and there was none then they said they could give me store credit and i would go line up in checkout and order a new one since i got mine on a discount i had to pay the price difference this is ridiculous they wouldnt order a replacement for a defective product unless i pay more got a refund in the end even though i liked the product otherwise and would much prefer an exchange i guess purchases with discounts are not protected,1.0,negative
i have alexa now  months runningyou would expect that alexa can anwser many many questions it can maybe but you have to know which app has the answer you have to install the app and you have every time to say a special commands  stupid alexa is out of the box very stupid and after investing hours  she is not much more knowledgeable its a stupid ai,1.0,negative
so i was already not too pleased with amazons choice to only include an essentially useless charger when purchasing a kindle hd and caved to ordering the fast charger so it would not take hours of nonuse to recharge for  you dont even get a full charger just an adapter to put on to the cord they already gave you amazon please just charge the real price for the device instead of settling to slowly rip people off with essential accessories this sort of thing cheapens your image and erodes loyalty,1.0,negative
i opened up this package fresh and put two aa batteries in my xbox one controller it only lasted for a few hours of gameplay when i took the batteries out they seem quite warm i used my heat gun and they were f i got a new set of two batteries and placed it in my controller they only kept the controller on for less than a minute when i took the batteries out one burned my finger i grabbed my heat temperature gun and in certain spots it registered over im not going to try and use anymore in any electronics im not sure whats going on here amazon,1.0,negative

certified garbage lesson learned about paying attention to reviews fire tv box and remote was packaged like new even included new batteries after plugging it in it would only show amazon logo and unknown boot on screen cycled power several times and even tried to reset using remote buttons no dice i read all the negative reviews before i purchased this i chose to take the chance so im angry with myself but very disappointed with amazon for even suggesting this is refurbished let alone certified as if that means something,1.0,negative

i realized after purchasing that the reason you get so many for such great price is because it takes the entire box to equate to one  pack of more expensive batteries the life on these is terrible ive used them in everything from remote controls to kid toys and they run out very fast go ahead and spend the extra money for a better quality battery,1.0,negative
so i saw all the glowing reviews and was startled by the low price for  of this alkaline batteries yeah well now i am startled by how long they last uhoh make that dont last i dont take but  to  shots from my little finepix camera before the lens starts closing when i try to shoot compare that towell im not gonna lie i never counted but i took tons of shots using duracell alkaline bats conservative estimate at least  shots for each set of two einstein not needed to do the math on that i just looked and see that they are made in indonesia which may or may not matter since i dont know where duracells are made i still have  of these lousy things left ticks me off royallynow let us see if this shows as a confirmed purchase,1.0,negative

ouch i bought this fire tablet and used it for about four hours and left it on a charger a couple of hours later i picked up the tablet and the screen was showing a weird ghosting effect and then the screen went completely blacki twisted the chassis and screen a bit and managed to get things working again just long enough to do a factory reset and return the tabletim sure i had a defectivedamaged tablet but i was underwhelmed with the quality and it would be nice if amazon brought back the higher quality hdx tablets for people who dont mind paying more for quality tablets,1.0,negative
i bought this tablet because it seemed worth it for the price however it only lasted  months before the battery died and was not chargeable regardless of troubleshooting and what cord or outlet i usedbest buy said they couldnt do anything but said amazon could help me since it should be under warranty i escalated multiple times with amazon and they refused to help me each time so save your  and put it towards a good product,1.0,negative

these batteries dont last they might be a good value but for me its more important to have a battery that lasts longer or use these for hiking and rockclimbing and working on my car in the middle the night if i have a flat tire if you use them like that you want a much better battery like the name brands duracell energizer etc if you just want something thats cheap these batteries are definitely cheap but i bought the  count duracell batteries for  each i think the amazon ones go for just a bit over  each i think the duracells last more than a third longer,1.0,negative
i waited to write this review until i had tried nearly all of the batteries that i ordered most of them did not have any power in them the few that did work lasted maybe an hour i pitched the remaining  because i cannot depend on them at this point maybe i just got a bad batch but these are the worst collection batteries i have ever used i would not recommend these to anyone else based on my experience,1.0,negative
last less than a quarter as long as even offbrand batteries such as rayovac creating a lot more waste with name brand batteries my wireless keyboard would last almost a year these amazon branded batteries last only  months if they werent considered hazardous waste when spent i might have given them  stars on account of there low price but when you consider how hard it is to dispose of batteries properly and how much time youll spend changing them out of your favorite devices theyre really not worth your time,1.0,negative
had to replace my sons lenovo android tablet and at the same time renew the warranty had a few options of brands to choose for the replacement lots of family suggested the amazon even the best buy staff said it was the better choice not to mention the cheapest of the four brands to pick from well set up was a disaster i wasnt aware that this tablet lets you put up to four names under one amazon account until after the initial account member name was completed so now my  yr old has an amazon account also didnt lime that i had to put in credit info for set up and then had to go into settings to put a parental block on inapp purchases too many ad pop ups and thats just while it is turning on in not happy with this tablet  it automatically backs up photos and stuff to an icloud i dont know what that is  how to access it nor is there an icon on the screen for it also lots of unnecessary pages and icons all over the screen that cant be changed my other sons tablet is in need of replacement and warranty renewal i will not be replacing his with this product,1.0,negative
i have bought these twicemy first purchase i received the batteries in the silver packaging had no issues long battery life etc the second order i received the batteries in the gray packaging as pictured i bought the second back in april and last week i discovered that every unused battery that i hadnt used up and thrown out was leaking i threw out  batteries one day and found  more that were in use in remotes that needed to be thrown out as well because they had leaked and had to throw out a remote as well since it had corroded insideim not going to be buying again i could forgive one leaking battery but almost half the package ill either buy another brand for a bit more money and quality or go to a local dollar store for the same quality and less money,1.0,negative
these are the worst batteries i have ever encountered anywhere in my year life i am appalled that amazon put their name on them i guarantee that if these had been my first amazon purchase i would never have done business here again if they had not been wrapped in packs of  batteries in cellophane i would have been certain that someone else had used them all up and then returned these batteries to amazonnone of the batteries was anywhere close to full power  they couldnt provide adequate power to anything i tried them in for any batterypowered item to work properly candles and flashlights were so dim i would have required more of them than i am physically capable of carrying to avoid tripping over my own feet none of the appliance remotes would even turn their respective appliances on after these batteries were inserted every item i tried these batteries in also stopped working completely due to a dead battery in less than  minutesobviously i should have returned these batteries and im sure i would have done so if my mom had not had a heart attack shortly after i received them i am just grateful she is now doing so well that neither she nor her cardiac surgeon have to rely on any batterypowered device,1.0,negative
the reviews on this on amazon seemed awesome little did i know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets we just bought this for christmas and went to charge it for the first time nothing we already loaded and paid for several apps and now were out that money also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before  theres some wear at the edge of it so i went online to see if i could find this issue and there it is  everywhere this is a problem that has been around for years but android  who is the ultimate culprit has failed to fix it at the source when you plug in the charger theres no click so you know its in place it just slides in and out weve had apple products for several years and never had an issue then the first droid product we purchase cant even be charged from the beginning this will be going back to bestbuy  and will buy another ipad mini  costs more but is much much more reliable,1.0,negative
arrived and maybe only  of the batteries actually worked the ones that did not work have little juice to them or some are just deadsucks because when i ordered aa batteries from the amazon brand a while back they worked amazing and were of great price these are cheap but when you factor in how many of them you can actually use this was not a cheap buy at all,1.0,negative
i bought this product from amazon about a month ago the reviews seemed great so i gave them a tryafter using the batteries in my xbox one controllers for about  weeks the controller began to malfunctionupon further inspection i checked the batteries and the compartment was a little bit wet so i cleaned it up and went to get new batteries still in the plastic wrapper and all of the batteries had an oily residue around them some type of leakage overall dont save money here as you might lose your equipment and the money you spend on the batteries,1.0,negative
this   version should have been marketed to children only its like a very dumbed down cheap version of the better firehd and hdx screen is not as good battery life is bad no mirroring to tv and its slooowww as can be if youve never owned another kind of kindle you will probably be accepting of this watered down version for those that know what a real kindle should be like you may want to pass on this one another version should be along soon and since they cant get much worse than this one youll probably get a better one i got mine on black friday for a little over  total with shopping discounts and im still sending it back thats how disappointed i am with it,1.0,negative
i purchased this item on the recommendation of many existing owners however when i got home and attempted to set up the device it was frustrating and the instructionsfaqs were not very helpful the echo could not find my nest thermostat nor could it find about half of my hue lights once i argued and fought with alexa for about  minutes she finally started to pick up my lights and after comletely reconfiguring my thermostat she could see it but she would not work with it once she found all of my lights she would turn them on or off but would not change colors or brightness levels i run a software company and have worked in and with computers my whole life this should not have been this quirky i would not recommend this item get a google home,1.0,negative

ill give them two stars for the price but you really do get what you pay for these batteries seemed to die a lot faster than the kirkland ones i got from costco or maybe its just some of them that fail too soon i put several new amazon aa batteries in a few different devices that get a good amount of use when a couple of those devices stopped working i tested the batteries in both cases only one battery was actually dead the other was fine that seems weird weird enough that ill go back to costco for my next battery purchase,1.0,negative
i dont know if i got a bad batch but im getting less than two weeks of use when i use them in my baldwin keyless deadbolt httpswwwamazoncombaldwinaccylinderelectronicdeadboltdpbucy which takes  aa batteries the duracell alkaline usually last  months so im pretty appalled at how short these im in san francisco and it doesnt get that cold so i dont think thats the problemive tested the batteries with my tester httpswwwamazoncomdpbgsby and it indicates they are good and in the green yet wont drive the deadboltwhen i took the weakened batteries out of the deadbolt that still show green and put them in my headlamp httpswwwamazoncomfenixhlheadlampxpgfenixhlxpggolddpbshuxy they only give about  minutes before they completely die,1.0,negative
i bought this to replace a year old kindle fire  hdx that i had just dropped on the floor i sort of panicked so after doing a couple of hours of research i picked this tablet just to be on the safe side i got  additional gb of memory i installed a couple of games none of them memory hogs and a cookbook app in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries i can honestly say this is the slowest tablet ive ever had just rotating the screen takes  seconds and thats if theres only one app open opening a book or magazine can take half a minute and god help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while youre cooking amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers since there are no other fire tablets available for whatever reason maybe theyre being discontinued ill be replacing it with either an ipad or a galaxy tablet,1.0,negative
this thing is a disaster unless you are a child or have never used a tablet in your life you are in for disappointment theyve blocked the google store so good luck downloading most of the games you like youtube owned by google so again cant download the app you can get there with the web browser but why should you have to i tried to download  games none of which would even load in short i owned it less than  hours waste of my time save your money and buy a samsung galaxy tablet,1.0,negative
i am reading positive reviews and wish i could say the same best buy is great so this is not a reflection on them just our experience with the product we have had this product for just over one month and i have had to contact amazon support perform factory resets to get content to show up and the device is poorly designed as the sd card pops out constantly which messes with drm and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the internet to fix it we are returning and spending the extra money for an ipad will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience if you just use the device for reading maybe this is for you but trying to download information to sd card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating as well as having to do factory resets so content owned already purchased on amazon would show up on the device in the library,1.0,negative
lasted for barely any time at all i have no idea why some batteries last longer than others but i can attest that these were stored in the exact same condition in our home as another brand of battery and the amazon ones lasted for far less than half the life of the namebrands im always willing to give amazon products a try but these batteries left a lot to be desired,1.0,negative
sorry amazon i love you but these batteries are terrible they dont last long at all reordered before i realized that they peter out in short order they have failed in every application requiring batteries unfortunately their made in indonesia wasnt putting them in the china slot immediately but have no choice to do so applications referred to are tooth brush remote controls motion lights etc purchased aaa aa with no difference in performance i enjoyed the idea of being stocked up on quantity but the quantity doesnt replace quality wont be ordering these batteries again but will be shopping for a superior productjmac,1.0,negative
sorry amazon you guys are great at what you do by selling your products at reasonable prices and good no hassle returns and i am a very happy customer but i purchased a box each of your aaa aa and d cell batteries i have used the aaas for remotes with no apparent problems so far i have not used the d cells yet but the aa batteries are the worst batteries i have ever used they dont last long in my flash lights my son had four batteries that actually blew up inside the unit i heard a loud pop while the unit was playing after five minutes or so i wanted to know what happened and looked inside the unit and the green  negative containment ringsealer had blown out and acid was all over the inside of the unit i had to throw the rest of these batteries in the trash because i am worried about my little ones getting acid on them amazon your good name should not be on those bad batteries,1.0,negative
i like shopping with amazon and have purchased several amazon brand products however i would not recommend anyone buy these batteries i opened up the box and took a pack of four batteries out of the case and one was leaking i threw those away i need batteries for one of my sons toys so opened up another pack and put the batteries in and you guessed it there was no charge in the batteries at all about half of the batteries in the box were dead on arrival the other ones had a charge but did not last long save your self the headache and buy energizers or something else you will pay more but they work i tried to return this pack but i was out of the  day window to return so im out the money,1.0,negative
i purchased them thinking they would be a great value based on other reviews i have an alarm keypad among other things that i use them in previously batteries would last about a year in the keypad these batteries will last about a month before they die the first time it happened i thought there could have been a bad battery or possibly my memory was failing me after  sets in  months there is no doubt the batteries test fully charged when i install them and then a month later they are gone that is not a great value at all i will find another battery for future use,1.0,negative
its very appealing for the price but know in advance that the warranty is only  days i did not so when my sons device stopped charging due to a lose charging port a little over  months after he got it i didnt rush to call i have been taking care of seriously ill family members so i put customer service on the bottom of my list of priorities since i thought i had time especially knowing that these types of calls can sometimes take hours which i didnt have today my son was home sick so i had the day to do the things at the bottom of my list so i called amazon  minutes later after doing all their trouble shooting steps three times and being disconnected once she decided to tell me that my warranty was only for  days but she would be happy to help me buy one for only  ok after i calmly explained to he that that was full price and i wasnt about to spend that again on a device that barely made it two months she put me on hold and  minutes later she told me that they would generously give me  off my next purchasemoral of the story know before you buy  if you still buy call the minute the thing breaks even if that means your mom will be an hour late for chemo i guessalso during my  minute search for who to call about the defect since it wasnt on the box i found the amazon support number on a thread with at least  other people talking about their defective charging ports keep that in mindif  is something you can spend every  months it might be worth it,1.0,negative
i bought a kindle fire gb for my  year old son in june after  months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge best buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it amazon will not warranty their product for more than  days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them they have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if i buy a new one amazon does not stand behind this product they are aware of the defect and continue to sell these,1.0,negative
this is the first amazon product ive purchased i thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really cant be much difference between alkaline batteriesi am a working musician teacher i sing with a band and use a shure wireless beta  mic a normal set of alkaline batteries last about  hours in my mic the first gig i used these with was about   hours with the mic on and by the end of the gig the light on the mic showing battery was showing that the battery was about to die i was just lucky that it lasted long enough for the entire gig usually i can get two full gigs out of an alkaline battery just as a comparison i usually buy the cheapest boxes of batteries at lowes those batteries are only slightly more expensive than the amazon basics and last twice as long in my mici cant say how these batteries work in other things but i can say that for what i use them for they are a big waste of money i would rather use batteries that cost  more and last twice as long,1.0,negative
we purchased this tablet for our  y ear old since all the other kidfriendly tablets were limited it what they had on them something should be changed regarding the port for the charger the little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point  months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended i am over tablets if you can buy it on black friday for  bucks or less it should be that price all year long so now he has no tablet because i am not sending it out to have someone elses sent back to merefurbished i am very disappointed,1.0,negative
i will never purchase batteries online ever again i should have never believed that this is unique japanese technology that enables better performance after storage overdischarge and high temperatures because frankly it did not even last for two days for my digital clock that has four placements of aaa batteries at first i believed it was a bad batch of a four pack batteries no problem then a week and a half has passed and i had to change the batteries for my clock five times i hope this review will convince you the reader to never purchase these batteries i know they are not that expensive and i shouldnt make a big deal out of it but it is frustrating to see the seller lie more than once took their sweet a time to deliver it to the buyer about a month in waiting and never sent any form of confirmation in purchasing their product well thats that have a good one,1.0,negative
i used these to replace the batteries in my digital safe a week or two later i needed to access something from the safe but it wouldnt open i was sure i was entering the right code but the safe just beeped and didnt unlock i didnt suspect the batteries right away because they were still almost new but eventually i plugged in a different brand and thats all it took the get the safe to work properly again it was a big relief and interesting to find out that aa batteries arent all created equal,1.0,negative
update ive been trying to use up the last of the batteries and two more have been found leaking acid since the previous review i didnt want to just throw them out but at this point is isnt worth the mess and damage to devicesoriginal reviewbought two packs of these on subscribe and save in the last couple months we play laser tag and the guns require  batteries each so i thought this would be a good source of cheap batteries for our  guns i put these in about a week ago after having the batteries sitting on a shelf for a couple months we played a game and then put the guns up the next time we played  about  days later i noticed an oily liquid running out of one of the guns the battery was leaking acid and it had run out of the battery compartment and was all over the outsidei get that it happens to other batteries as well but thats usually after sitting in a device for months not a few days i would not trust these in anything expensiveand take them out immediately after use i wont buy again sorry no picsi was busy cleaning up the mess,1.0,negative
i ordered these thinking they were rechargeable i recognize the error on my part but that is not my complaint here  so when i received them and used them i was not surprised that they died very quickly upon attempting to recharge these i figured out they arent rechargeable once again big duh on my partnow im seriously surprised that im only getting a few hours of use out of them like a quarter of the use that a typical battery should offer horribly disappointed i will go back to the name brand batteries for sure,1.0,negative
we got this for our son he is always wanting to play on moms tablet so we thought this would be a good choice his aunt does a lot of tech shopping and bought this same one for his sister so we got the same one within a month the charging cord on both units quit working and shortly after that the ports became squirly so you have to hold them just right or they dont charge save your money and get a more expensive but better quality product,1.0,negative
i was excited about the prices of these batteries however you get what you pay for these batteries are awful ive used them in toys remotes and flashlights the remote lasted for like a week i used the flashlight for a few minutes and thats all the use i got out of them i unsubscribed to this item no thanks,1.0,negative
whats happened to batteries duracell use to be the gold standard until we had over  of them fail by leaking and destroying expensive medical equipment year after year costco batteries became our goto batteries until last year  when they started leaking even on the shelf tried eveready but price and quality varies as well i trusted amazon and love the price packaging convenience and no leaks but they dont last half the time the others have some of the top reviews have stated the electrical case very very well and yes we have some high current draw uses but as my staff and doctors have said to me theyre just batteries get us some decent batteries already we go through dozens a week so price is going to matter but paying top dollar still doesnt seem to save equipment or increase the usage time it seems every manufacture is changing their product for cost and marketing so that you have to be an expert to properly match basic aa batteries to your specific use not cool,1.0,negative
i bought this charger nov   its now jan   a little over a month later and the device doesnt charge my kindle any longer i have the kindle shutdown and allow it to be plugged in for multiple hours after i take the charger off and start to use my kindle within  minutes i see the low battery message if i use the charger that came with my kindle for the same amount of time i dont see the low battery message as quickly as i did with this charger not sure whats going on but makes me think i have a faulty device  costs a lot of money for something that doesnt work any longer than  month,1.0,negative
i got two of these batteries with my fire tv stick loaded them in and everything was good for  days then the fire tv stick stopped responding i trouble shooted with no fix called customer service and they had me trouble shoot too started by saying can you change the batteries my response  seriously you want me to change the batteries its a freaking tv stick what could possibly be wrong the batteries are brand new and came with the device so i was changing the batteries as i was saying all that only for the new batteries to fix the problem so these amazon batteries died in  days how does that happen,1.0,negative
bought these march  its now feb  and my son said his toy lightsaber had just stopped working opened it up and batteries have leaked causing corrosion to contacts no longer works even with new batteries its not a very expensive toy but the  most important aspect of a battery is that it not leak whats the point of saving a few dollars on batteries if they are going to ruin something much more expensivewith major brands you can send in leaked batteries and device for repair or refund although ive never done thisthe version i bought were silver and green so perhaps they have changedleaked batteries had v respectively,1.0,negative
bought these because i had heard from several sources that alkaline batteries are one of those items that you can buy as generics and get comparable quality to name brands it is not unusual for me to keep batteries in storage for more than a year without a problem with leakage these after a year would begin leaking soon after installing them that is they come out of their protective wrap looking brand new but would leak within days they fouled up a few things one of which was a good work flashlight i hadnt seen a battery leak in decades i had to throw out the remaining ones even though they looked deceptively good,1.0,negative
i suppose the most honest thing about them is in their namebasic i use them in my blood pressure monitor i take my bp twice a day and it only takes about  seconds the batteries only last about  weeks ive also used them in my air conditioner remote which i might use once or twice a day just to turn it on or off again after about    weeks they stop working they are also used in my alexaecho remote which is used more often yet they last about  months in it this is the first amazon labeledmade product that i have bought that was not rated a  dont buy these if you are looking for a long lasting battery,1.0,negative
i love amazon i am a prime member have had an amazon credit card for  years think their service and pricing is second to nonebut these batteries are garbage garbagethey really dont work or at the very least dont work most of the time even when they do appear to work they only last like  of the time a normal aa would maybe you can justify the pricing for certain situationsshould you use them for led string lights and hope they last a couple months yepportable defribrilator norc car surecamera for younger sisters wedding in the greek isles nopevibrating nose hair trimmer okcomputer battery for your  hour flight to siberia nyetget my drift sure try them out and keep trying them like i have but dont put any faith in them,1.0,negative
aside from the fact that the saleman told me that the tablet would be able to get all the same apps that an android tablet would be able to get from the playstore which was hilariously wrong this product would never connect to the internet correctly i had to reset the internet every single time on the table for my son to use it starting from day one and up my son loved having the electric device and i didnt take it back for those reasons but now  days out the thing doesnt even charge anymore and im having to take it back in at least i bought the warrenty because this is literally a huge waste of money id rather have spent  on a different tablet than this garbage,1.0,negative
i came here to look at the one and two star reviews and see that people are saying the same thing ive been thinking since trying to use my first shipment of these batteries which are supposed to be better than the previous version that they replaced ive used  of these batteries so far and each one has barely lasted  weeks in my mouse the previous version usually lasted a couple months at least it seems like in this day and age its rare that when things are supposedly improved upon that theyre actually better i can only guess that amazon found a cheaper supplier for their branded batteries i guess its time to cancel my subscribe and save subscription since im not the only one who finds these batteries to be subpar to their predecessors if the rest of the batteries in this pack perform better ill update my review to reflect thatedited to add on  now that the th battery from this pack lasted just over  weeks in my mouse i will be contacting amazon customer service as i mentioned previously the older version of these batteries worked so well that i have to wonder why they changed them i see the larger size amazon batteries still carry the older name,1.0,negative
i went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews but my experience was not a good one from the start i was on the phone every day for at least an hour with amazon tech support for one issue or another most of the techs were very polite but not all knew the product very well at one point i asked one of them about trying to save some ram and they kept referring me to the storage which told me they didnt even know the difference between ram and regular storage the internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times even when all my other wifi devices ran great then a day would pass and id be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop workingwtf come to find out its a known issue and theyre working on it after two weeks of one thing after another i got fed up and just returned it i wanted it to work and gave it a good run but just not quality stuff to me it was like walmart trying to build their own computer when theyre obviously not a computer manufacturer neither is amazon if i were you id look at a regular android tablet from a reputable pc manufacturer which is exactly what i did next i got an asus tablet for only a few dollars more and its unbelievable  better in comparison to the amazon fire hd save yourself the aggravation and go with asus or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time sorry amazon not this time,1.0,negative
absolute junk my devices run only    days with these batteries and probably half have been dead when i put them in my devices save your money buy duracell batteries from groupon they will stand behind less than quality batteries but amazon will not once you buy amazon batteries as has become the case with most of amazon you are on your on without a paddleamazon did send me replacement batteries however they are the same as the original ones i dont know how anyone can give a positive review just terrible,1.0,negative
one star because this shouldve been included when i purchased my kindles bought this second one because i have three paper whites and got tired of playing musical charge chairs and if amazon would concentrate on the loyal ebook readers rather than the useless fires and increase memory more than the little bit they did on the latest kindle i own one i would be a happy camper we need the option of adding memory amazon invent a chip that only you sell and the only one a kindle can use and ill purchase just give us that option fires dont work for just straight up reading cant read in any kind of light because of the shiny screen having to purchase these power adapters separately ticks me off i dont care about the cloud i need books downloaded to my devices we vacation often in our mountain house middle of nowhere which i like however no wifi no internet access and no cell coverage so cloud is useless i guess i read too much thousands of books  in my library at home before a stroke forced me to kindle and now thousands more include adapters when purchasing devices and increase the storage capacity,1.0,negative

been using amazon aa and aaa batteries over the past  months in a variety of electronic items and have found that they do not last as long as higher quality higher price batteries i guess you get what you pay for,2.0,negative
might be okay but they seem cheap they have warm light orangeish in color they have the feeling that they might only last a year or too and not multiple christmas seasons we are doing a timer test and have one that does not want to follow the standard timer also the window suction cup things are to small for these candles they will ultimately work but are going to be stretched to do so picture is of the loan gunmen candle screw the built of n timer,2.0,negative
the fire  has a great price you get your moneys worth however you may have to do an exchange if you get a damaged one the one i bought had a busted pixel in the screen there was no damage to the case or glass screen but the image had a bright white puncture hole in the screens image ive owned multiple but i have never had this problem before with an epad tablet when i just bought it i will now have to visit best buy again tomorrow for an exchange im hoping theyre still in stock its not best buys fault the fault lies with amazon theyre clearly not that durable,2.0,negative
amazon seems to have changed the manufacturer of this battery i liked it very much the last year but the new one has a different look has noticeably lower capacity and leaks batteries usually leak after they die but these leaked while they were still good and apparently died because of the leak all of my devices have battery monitored one day they were good with  power left and they died suddenly the next day the leaks were mostly minor but clearly noticeable from body discolorationone thing that has not changed from before is the packaging and it is still bad they are shrinkwrapped  in a package and they are hard to open as there is no cutout or pulltab to break the wrap it is difficult to break open by hand twisting the package causes undue stress to the batteries and that may be cause of the leak i have had to use scissors or knife to cut open the package,2.0,negative
amazon fire is a good tablet if you like ebooks its also nice to get a sixmonth subscription to the washington post their claim to have  gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you  and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage  another problem is that you cant flag something as being inappropriate like you can on samsung galaxy tablets,2.0,negative

alexa is tall slim and attractive but too jealous to use google and that makes her rather dumb and she is just a shill for amazon prime dropping the personification music volume changes annoyingly with different songs and over time the database amazon echo draws from is very limited alexa can tell you what the weather is but not what the most common womans shoe size is what serena williams age is but not how many guns ruger sold last year stand by for more techsavvy companies to take the echo concept to maturity,2.0,negative

worked wonderful and fast the first couple of weeks and then just stopped working i understand that sometimes things are just a defective piece so i logged into amazon and attempted to exchange it but found out the window for exchanging it had closed i would have attempted to return it sooner but i was out of state for several weeks visiting and helping my daughter who had just given birth to triplets and so id decided i would just wait till i returned home to do it by the time i got around to it it was too late so i totally wasted my money if amazon corrects this matter and send me a replacement i will update my review,2.0,negative
and then theres cheap yeah cheap batteries alright but also cheap performance these last half the time the cs house brand batteries in the same unit for only just a little less money disappointed as i was hoping amazon might try to only put their name brand on half way decent stufftheres a reason they send you a whole big box of em  youll go through em fast,2.0,negative

i was quite disappointed when i began working through the menus and discovered that my  year old roku  was far more intuitive roku also allows searches of all of your subscribed services if i am already paying a subscription fee to netflix or hbo now and i can watch a tv show or movie without additional cost why should i pay amazon to watch it i am a fan of amazon services and a prime member but i also dont want to throw my money away roku is still the best,2.0,negative
we bought wowwee mip robots for our grandsons  and  years old they dont have ipad or iphone in their home so thoroughly researched what else would work for installing the app talked with best buy salesperson who said the app could be loaded via the app store it cantkindle fire  is included on the wowwee compatibility list so we bought them each a brand new kindle in order to use the app they had kindles from earlier years but these wouldnt support the bluetooth functionality needed for the robotsabsolute fail we tried every possible configuration adult vs child amazon accounts bluetooth on first or off first mip on first or off first etc it never worked at all  not even oncealso tried full factory reset on each device loading the app via a google play account rather than amazon kindle account google play wouldnt load the app said it wasnt compatible with this kindle deviceopened a ticket on wowwee the response was that theyve had the same experience  the bluetooth on this kindle fails and so the app doesnt work with the wowwee robots they admit it fails yet its still on their approved listso this was an absolute waste of money tho at least the boys can play some free games we loaded for them,2.0,negative
i had the original fire stick and i dont truly see that great of a difference between the new and older version i was hoping that whe the new version came out i could really understand and justify why i was paying more for a new one when my old one worked just fine unfortunately i cant for me its not worth the money and i returned the item and stuck with my other one,2.0,negative
i am on my rd kindle this software downloads new purchases with a picture of the cover of the book on my homepage only about a fifth of the available space so this would only allow you to buy at most four books at a time before the covers would be too small the new books should be downloaded to my library in list form as in the original kindle in addition once you have looked at a book in the homepage it disappears and you have to search for it or place it in a category finally this system disallows you from manipulating books the way you want this os is definitely not user friendly it requires a great deal of effort of the user a lot of wasted data space and waste of time i am requesting a return to the original kindle os,2.0,negative
certainly not as good as duracell some are very good others go bad in as little as two weeks i put  in a pluggedin weather radio to serve as battery back up got a message that batteries needed replacing after only  weeks a battery tester confirmed that they should be replaced i guess i will go back to the duracells,2.0,negative
good price but batteries just dont last as long as name brands my hope was to power christmas decorations through the holidays and save a few bucks many of these batteries did not make it in the future i will stick with proven brands,2.0,negative
i dont want to get too negative on this because it does what its supposed to however im not sure how amazon justifies charging  half that and id feel a lot less disappointed its nothing like the last generation cover which was hefty and substantial that thing could take a beating this one ummnot so muchpros i really like the solution amazon came up with to lock the kindle in place sort of a rubberized cup that grips it on all four sides and holds it very securely no more metalprong sliderelease gizmo it looks quite nice and is genuine if untextured leather like the last onecons flimsy the leather is extremely thin and unpadded wont stand up to much abuse scrape it even lightly on a rough surface and youll likely ruin it the actual cover that folds over the front is incredibly floppy and delicate  its about the thickness of a piece of notepad cardboard i could bend it in half with almost no effort if i had the notion cover has no lockclosure mechanism like the elastic strap on the last gen model it should have somethingoh well it is what it is i never read with the kindle in the case anyway so its not such a big deal to me but i was expecting more especially for this price,2.0,negative
item was doa reached out to amazon it who this happens often i stand gratification was thrown straight out the window i returned the item to bb where i purchased the appel tv much better product and works which is more than i can say for the fire tv i give the item a  star instead of a  because amazons it was quick to answer the phone and troubleshoot,2.0,negative

it is tough to use these tablets if you are use to apple products internal memory is minimal and is taken up by all of the amazon programs it is running everytime my kids play a game the wireless connection shuts down due to running out of memory i would not recommend these tablets for anything more that an ebook reader,2.0,negative
not the best case amazon has ever put out i have a number of other amazon brand kindle and kindle fire cases for my various kindle devices and this is the least effective of the bunch it doesnt stand in any position so i cant use my  hands free it also doesnt line up properly when closed so the fire seems to come out of sleep mode thus draining the battery more quickly and finally i have discovered that i do prefer the leather covers over whatever material this is made from i understand that the cost of a leather case would probably be half the cost of the kindle fire hd not that this case was any bargain at ,2.0,negative

i bought this tablet on black friday and it was on sale its incredibly slow and the screen quality is mediocre what bothered me the most were the ads on the tablet i only really use it to watch netflix so its fine but dont expect anything above that to function well on this device,2.0,negative
not a very good battery they drain really fast i use them in my roku remote i plug my headphones into the remote for wireless listening so im not sure if that is a factor but ive used several different batteries in the remote and none of them drained nearly as quick as these did im talking a week and they are dead i would not recommend them,2.0,negative
so i purchased a pack of these a month ago dec and was using them as expected when i hit a snag at least  batteries from this pack were marginalundervoltage v out of the box i found this out because i had replaced a pair of batteries in one of my remote sensors for my wall mounted indoor weather station because the had sensor stopped working i thought maybe i had inserted them wrong but no the  marks matched the batteries so i tried several times to reset both the sensor and the station with no luck at one point i had all of the batteries out to force a reset and put them back but now my weather station would not power up eitherthat was the clue i needed i got my trusty multimeter with battery tester and checked out all  of the amazon basics aa cells like all new v batteries most of them showed v which is typical two of them were at v which was just low enough for them to be considered undervoltage no new aa battery should arrive with v this is the first and only time i have ever seen fresh batteries arrive in a not as new condition with caused problems with my electronicsi generally like all of the various amazon basics products mice hdmi cables etc but this has caused me to have doubts about not only their aa batteries but all of the house branded products buyer beware caveat emptor seems to be the bottom line,2.0,negative
the constant bombardment of ads when i turn on my tablet is not an experience that i enjoy i would recommend you buy any other than one that runs the fire os for the same price you can get a cheap android tablet and do a lot more with it,2.0,negative
its a nice idea if you have a need for such a gadget my opinion was it wasnt worth the money computers and smart phones do mostly the same thing so why have an additional gadget it might be more worthwhile for someone that wants to use it for running smart gadgets around the house not for me so i returned it,2.0,negative
my initial impression of this was very good the material is nicer than the shiny stuff on my hama cd binders and the netting trim gives a nice appearance compared to plain look of most budget cd bindersthere are  pages with  disc pockets each  per side giving a total of  capacity the pages are hung from the spine in two groups of  by that i mean that  pages all have a single attachment point to the plastic spinethis is where the first problem with this binder lies because each group of  pages shares the same anchor point in the spine the pages cannot sit flat once full of discs they bend and arch and apart from looking tatty this puts a lot of tension across the plastic film with longterm usage i suspect this plastic film will will tear due to the tension it also makes it awkward to browse the binder as the pages dont sit flat it may even crack or bend your discsi look to my hama  binder to see how it should be done  it only has  pages and yet they were smart enough to hang them from the spine in  bundles of  this spreads out the pages and allows easy browsing of the binder without putting any of the pockets under tensionafter just  weeks in storage i opened the binder and the corners of all the pages have become dogeared by themselves this is due to the poor design and poor fit of the binder pages when filled with discs again it is not a problem i have seen with my other disc binders my twoyearold hama binders look as good as newoverally this binder has a lot of storage at a good price if thats all you want you will probably be happy with the product but sloppy design prevents it from being anything more than a mediocre binder i feel that whoever designed this did not bother to fill it with discs to see how it would cope,2.0,negative
somewhat disappointed with these batteries they die rather quickly im not using them for things that use a lot of power either like the remote for my tv i have to change them frequently expiration date of  but they go fast unless i got a bad batch i would rate them down there with cheap ravovac or a grocery store brand,2.0,negative
i thought that this was a great deal but the batteries dont seem to last very long i feel like i am constantly having to change the batteries in my remote i would equate these to being a little bit better than dollar store batteries but they are not of the highest quality,2.0,negative
got this for my yo daughter a lot of the times it doesnt work i have to restart it a lot and it only has  apps that i added on it it came with way too many preloaded apps and the most annoying thing is that the kids profile is permanently horizontal not really worth the money for me but at least shes playing her inside out bubble game on her own tablet instead of my ipad,2.0,negative
i am extremely disappointed with these batteries which stems not from longevity or power but with fit almost immediately upon receiving them i installed them into three electric candles no joy i cleaned the contacts still no joy i tested the batteries full charge just for grins i installed into one candle three rayovac brand batteries and the candle lit with no problem removed the rayovacs installed the amazons and again no joy i repeated this a couple of times with the same results and i tried this in the other two candles with identical results all three candles lit with the rayovacs none with the amazons knowing the issue was not with candles i took a rayovac and lined it up with an amazon and discovered something interesting the batteries were just a wee bit differentthe length of the positive terminals are different just a tad longer on the rayovac see picture the rayovac terminal is taller longer while the amazon terminal is squattier and therefore shorter the difference in length is tiny no question but when youre putting batteries into a rather cheap device to start with that tiny bit of length in this case seems to be the difference between one battery forming a sufficient connection and the other one not ill keep the amazons to use in devices mice for example that are likely more solidly built than these candles and have a greater connection tolerance or a stronger spring to hold the battery firmly in place i am concluding that when replacing batteries in an older device that may not force as firm a connection or in a cheapo device that may not hold batteries tightly from the getgo use a brandedname batteryi am a longtime and extremely satisfied user of amazon basic computer cables among their first products in the basics line but was recently disappointed with another item i purchased outside of the computer connectors and cables line that being dog housetraining piddle pads which have not proven as absorbent as similarlypriced products and ive bought a lot of different brands the batteries were my second foray into basics product lines outside of the ohsodependablecables arena and now im  for  in the disappointed column i never thought there was a difference in batteries and now i know differently the next time i see a duracell commercial emphasizing reliability and dependability ill think back to this experience as i will when selecting batteries in the future i so wanted to like these amazon batteries too,2.0,negative
they are batteries and they do work but not for long i pretty much base battery quality by how long they last in my wireless mouse generally i have to replace my home mouse every  months i purchased these amazon basics aa performance alkaline batteries  months ago in that time ive replaced my home mouse battery  times the rd being yet again today my daughter has also gone through  batteries in her mouse as well though she spends most of her time on her laptop with the touchpadthe shipping was fast and you get several batteries for a low cost but i think a more economical way to go is to spend a little extra on name brand dependable batteries that last  times as long,2.0,negative

maybe i had higher expectationin general i will not recommend since the service of amazon solving situations is not as good as in other products ive had so much troubles with the amazon free time i am even not longer using it it was one of the big features on the advertisment i will recommend to look for other alternatives before to take a decision on buying this product,2.0,negative
it all depends on what your using a  dollar tablet to do is it for extreme gaming then i highly do not recommend this device it is better for light use on the safe side use for h a day h a day battery is the average but runs down faster and over heats when playing a d game but if u are on tight budget it is useful another major problem is that almost all apps that you would get on iphone and android are not availabe on the amazon fire appstore and there is no way to download them for example clash of clans racing rivals which have decided to withdraw from the amazon contract and delte there game off amazons app stores and other bigger titles omg even snapchat is not on there,2.0,negative
not happy that the product had no instruction book to go with it to help set it up not a big fan of the online tutorial had a really hard time in powering it off camera setting did not take very good pictures did not like the multiple ads on it every time i used it finally it locked up on me and i had a hard time getting it to go to settings so i could do anything with it probably will be returning this product to best buy,2.0,negative
i bought this tablet as a replacement for my wifes fire tv hdx  as her battery life is starting to decrease as it is getting older unfortunately she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise the next step is  which is way too big and has  less hours of battery life and i was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode hevc like the fire tv  boxes we have connected to our televisions this unfortunately is a show stopper as we cant view the movie library we have on this tablet we will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved,2.0,negative
pros amazon prime works on it you can still sideload apps like kodicons not a good upgrade over the original fire tv is worse in some aspects remote buttons are hard to press compared to original fire tv remote loses connection frequently and takes several button presses or removing of the remote batteries to fix interface isnt as snappy as the original fire tv same interface as the original fire tv theres still no good way to sort your apps or locate the prime content that you want voice search seems about the same as the original fire tv alexa adds nothing significant you still cant use it to search in rd party apps like youtube as for video decoding in kodi performance isnt much better than the original fire tv you will be able to play hevc content at p with no problem but p  hip softwaredecoded does not play well theres simply not enough power k decoding is hitand miss it needs to be specifically coded for this fire tv low bitrate low fps to work properly overall system performance is bad when sitting idle the cpus spike up to  usage and memory is at  usage the os is not welloptimizedim not confident that amazon can fix these issues in a timely manner and their competitors are releasing their media players soon so ill likely return this while i still can,2.0,negative

i want to start out by pointing out that i honestly was not expecting much to begin with i was just hoping for something backlit to read with at night my problem with it is that it was slow to the point where it was almost unusable just bite the bullet and get a more expensive model if youre new to amazon fire this is not representative of the experience of owning one,2.0,negative

i gave one star because they were batteries and did not explode in my face which is a major plus however if you need batteries for anything you use on a daily basis outside a tv remote then do not buy these batteries do not last as long as duracell or energizer by far and i wish i was getting paid to say that spend the extra dollars and buy a better battery,2.0,negative

i bought this thing refurbished i find that i have to unplug  plug back in the hdmi cable on a regular basis when switching inputs on the tv not sure if it is the amazon fire box itself or if it is the tv not likelyotherwise it is a good device i bought it for the ability to hard wire my ethernet connection to my gigabit switch and for k capabilities which it does do having the alexa app is handy but her features can be severely handicappedi probably should have just bought it new usually refurbished devices work well as they are tested before resale and it was probably tough to catch that the hdmi port on these might be finicky i may have to switch it out,2.0,negative

i was initially excited to get the kindle i am extremely disappointed with all the ads even more disappointed to find out that i could pay amazon more money to remove the ads its frustrating that best buy and more specifically amazon dont let the consumer know on the box or in store advertising that what youre buying is a mini advertising billboard why couldnt there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the low price is subsidized by all the ads on the device would this have changed my purchase absolutely i would have spent a couple bucks more and probably got a samsung tablet,2.0,negative

these batteries did their job but did not last very long at all at the time of writing this i used them about two months normally that would be good but i only was using them in a set of led string lights that i kept on at most an hour a day in the past month i barely used them at all because the batteries had started to die and alter the color of the lights i had expected to get a lot longer use out of them considering other brands i only need to change every six months at earliest,2.0,negative
this is a good tablet for children and adults too however there is an issue with the port and charger cable we did not even have this tablet  weeks before it would barley charge took it back to best buy and they said they could not fox it and imagine the port is not covered under the manufacturer warranty so now i have a tablet that takes a couple days to charge its really frustrating,2.0,negative
i received this as a christmas gift i was excited about this new product and downloaded the alexa app i am not an amazon prime member and i did not joined the free trial i asked questions to my alexa and it usually did not provide any answers or couldnt understand my questions despite giving simple commands the device looks good and the led light on top that turns on when you speak to it is great sound is good for music however i did not feel that it was a good assistant i did not like that you have to download skills to make alexa have more function you always had to speak alexa and then ask the skill you downloaded it then gets to a point that you dont even remember what skills you downloaded so you always had to look at your phone or mobile device to see what you had i exchanged it for the google home and it has been a better device it plays music from google music and not only music that you have purchased it answer a lot of questions and gives you great news briefing instead of downloading the particular skills it also provides more answers to questions and i was surprise by the detail of the answer at time i highly recommend to google home device i have not tested it with chromecast smart tv or with smart home appliances such as nest etc,2.0,negative
i thought i was getting a great deal but i learned the hard way if you don use them up quickly they go dead in a hurry extremely limited shelf life so dont buy these in bulk if you dont plan to use them w in  mos if your using them in medical equipment im sorry to say im choosing another battery i dont like bashing an amazon product and theres always the chance i got a bad batch but in this instance medical equipment you want power when you need i had several groans from the bfrnd about his tv remotes eating up his batteries i thought my wireless mice were eating them up as well so i bought another mouse but when i put  fresh packs in my tens unit  ea time they started out weak then didnt last  min ea set its time to choose another brand of battery not the product your putting it in i did test the ones i took out before putting the new ones in i didnt think to test them before putting them in,2.0,negative
i purchased my kindle in march of   and it came with this adapter and cord it is now october  and the small part of the adapter for this cord has stopped working fortunately i was able to plug the cord part into my laptops usb port and charge the kindle that way while plugged into a wall socket using amazons adapter it does not charge at all no light no charge no nothin i tried using the usbpower adapter for my ipod but the charge light blinked intermittently and it seemed to drain the kindles battery i have only had this for  months i think the adapter should last longer than that preferably amazon couldshould have come up with an interface that allows the use of adapters we already have  like for our phones or ipods its not rocket science but it is marketing i came online to purchase the replacement but im not sure i want to buy the same thing i have both the original kindle and the kindle and i love the product but with this adapter i have to ask why,2.0,negative
if its possible to have gotten a dud batch i sure got it we blew through all these batteries in less than a month my kids toys arent that super powered and even in remotes i was having to change batteries way too often for example the magic touch counting toy the store batteries lasted  years popped in some amazon batteries  month and the second child didnt play with it nearly as much as the first for the price it was worth the try but im going back to the other brands,2.0,negative
i was really excited to find a great deal on batteries i would have to say if you just used these batteries for remote controls and basic stuff then this would be the battery pick hands down i could not believe how many batteries i went through for a childs toy these batteries dont hold there ground against brand name i burnt through  amazon batteries in one month on my sons hot wheel course just basic use maybe an hour a day at most brand name has lasted  months,2.0,negative
i have to say this was not that great a purchase and we will most likely be taking advantage of its greatest product feature which is the ability to return it for a full refund we wanted a smaller tablet for our kids well this is smaller in every way options are limited and we have realized that we are better off just letting the kids use our tablet so we can buy the newest one this thing may go back to the store as soon as tonight,2.0,negative
its somewhat of a step up from the roku  i was previously using but not as much as i was expecting i think its a couple firmware updates away from being better than it is nowspent the good part of the day trying to figure out why i could only connect to my dualband router at ghz and not ghz  hours on the phone with verizon fios tech support was unsuccessful as other devices connected at ghz without issue was about to pack it up and return it until i called amazon tech support turns out its a knownissue that the firetv has difficulty with ghz networks that are set to auto channel selection and are utilizing channel numbers above the tech support person said i should change the channel to   or  instead of automatic and it workedbluetooth audio and video are out of sync with showtime netflix sling plex and hulu its fine through speakers but video lags slightly behind the audio using bluetooth audio and video are in perfect sync with bluetooth and amazon prime video which makes me think itll be fixed at some point as amazon provided video demonstrates it can work well in that regardgotta say i prefer the platform agnostic ui of roku with amazonworld tucked away in an app the firetv navigation pane represents mostly amazon products with no option to modify it rokus ui is more about the media less about the provider voice search works well if you want only to be presented with amazons viewing options for some reason i thought search was universal but only movies and tv shows available through amazon show up bummer the firetv is ok less than i was expecting and with other good options around the corner im beginning to doubt my choice,2.0,negative
i wanted to like this a lot because my ipad mini is heavy to carry in my purse all the time this is so very light but they make you jump through hoops to get rid of all the advertising on the device and when you buy it at best buy you are not given a choice to spend an extra  on a  dollar book or put up with their ads i had to go through being on hold forever to get someone to help get this off my device so that was an immediate turnoff i dont find it to pageturn handle as well as my old original nook or nook color and certainly not anything like the ipad mini if i hadnt kept it too long to return i would have it doesnt auto correct to landscape then portrate nope you have to manually choose one or the other and going back and forth is just stupidit should have been part of the improved design they really missed the mark for the price i can get a full tablet for less money that does all that and simply use the kindle appproslight weightsmall for purseback lightconscomes preloaded with adsnot easy to get them off if you buy device in a storepage control is not that simplet doesnt auto turn from landscape to portrate you have to set it to one or the othernot as touch responsive to anythingdont like the organization of it,2.0,negative
this really isnt a very good tablet by any measure other than bang for your buck i bought this for about  just to kill time on a couple of long flights so i didnt wear out the battery on my phone i definitely wouldnt recommend using this for reading as the screen resolution is really below average and be tough to look at i only used it to read some comics and play games on a screen bigger than a phone so i got what i wanted out of it,2.0,negative
the tablet was bought for a few family members two of which have bought several kindle books but only the price is the only note worthy thing about it if you buy it for  bucks you have pay another  to remove the ads and since this is from amazon there is no google play to get more app selectiontrue you can try to side load the google apps but the average tablet buyer wont do this also the battery life is poor compared to tablets like the ipad mini or other decent android slates id recommend a samsung tablet or an ipad before i would recommend this unless you have a very specific use for it and did not want to spend a lot of money,2.0,negative
when i got my kindle fire i got a protective cover for it and figured id be ok because i dont travel much at all am bedriddendisabled from car accidents after a while i couldnt get the miniusb cord to stay in the plug on the kindle after describing the problem to amazon they sent me a new cord i got the newer one with an ac plug and had to pay for it unfortunately this did not solve the problem and i had to mail them my kindle and they shipped me a new one configured mostly the way i had everything before i sent it which was very convenient using my new cable purchased through the amazon kindle store i had no problems at firstwith only very light use primarily for reading books for short intervals the problem i had before with the mini usb plug on the kindle not fitting tightly into its socket after changing up ac to usb as well as trying both usbs on my computer i was unable to get the kindle to start because it had less than  charge on the battery but i had no way to charge it the only way to resolve the issue would be to go through the procedure described above i read a number of the positive reviews which are usually posted first and nothing was mentioned about this problemthere were so many reviews i didnt have the time to go through them all im in the middle of a book and use the kindle to play scrabble with a friend and were in the middle of a gameso i havent decided what to do yet its after  am sunday morning so i cant call the kindle store for advicei had been considering upgrading to one of the new kindle products but after having this recurring problem i am leery of spending that kind of money only to possibly have the same issueread more,2.0,negative
so ive been wanting a fire since they originally came out read some questionable reviews about kindle basic stuff nothing seemed to really discourage me you really dont know what your experience will be unless you try so i got it and began the prime free trial  i was shocked to wake up this morning to find out i had been charged  for a full year of prime one day before my trial was supposed to end no email no contact no are you interested they just charged my card without warning imaginably upset with amazon the tablet it self is so so and is slightly basic the front facing camera is slightly better then the outwards one the alexa feature is kinda nice and fun to talk to it also syncs to other echo devices as well if buying for a teenager or any young adult do set parental controls and or passwords to keep from unauthorized perchues i think the tablet is ok but no great but because of my recent experience i rated it it  stars your ultimately going to make up your own mind and decided if your going to purchase this device and decide if its right for you good luck in your decision,2.0,negative
i usually buy the   battery special at harbor freight but they were not on sale when i needed some so i decided to get theseboth of the batteries are supposed to be alkaline so you would think they would both last about the same length of time no soi use these in a personal pedi callused skin grinder so they get a good workoutamazons batteries just dont last as long and its a noticeable differenceim going back to harbor freights alkalines,2.0,negative
i own a high end system with appletv  and chromcast media players for netflix and the likes i purchased fire tv for k as with other devices i thought i could configure it and forget it this is not the case with fire tv remote control requires constant attention open the back play with batteries but battery cover back on constantly hdmi port does not work with hdmi switch it is the only device that i own that does not play well with my switch internet connection is poor start receiving video wont load errors after a week i thought perhaps wifi connection was bad even though no other device had this issue so i tried wired connection and got same error tried restarting it more than any device should need but this did not help device is very hot it is on constantly no automatic method of turning off when not being usedon the plus side the interface is the best i seen on any media player beautiful picture and screen saver which can be configured alexia rocks but limited to basic commands amazon prime integration is excellent as you might expect beautiful looking device after about  days i got fed up and returned it ill wait for appletv to integrate k hopefully that will be soon,2.0,negative
if you are looking for an inexpensive tablet just for basic web surfingshoppingetc i dont know that you can get a better deal however that is about all you can do we found out the hard way that the fire which we bought to replace a misplaced ipad so maybe we were just spoiled is pretty limited in terms of the apps you can download forget about any google based apps and many of the standard apps that are generally available in the android or apple market place i love amazon itself and dont have any major issues with the product i got for the price i paid i just wont be going the cheap route in the future hindsight being  i should have spent the money to just get a new ipad since that is what we were used to,2.0,negative
i originally looked at a samsung in the store to purchase for my just turned  year old the salesperson talked me into buying this tablet it would be great for an older child as the learning games preloaded are pretty advanced they are way over my childs head and he is advanced for his age i thought that i might just be able to go to the playstore and download the learning games that i wanted from there but it will not let me access that very disappointed we dont really even use it maybe next year,2.0,negative
i didnt expect a lot at this price but i also did not expect both of my tablets to be riddled with deadstuck pixels right out of the box i have a third arriving in the mail and am just praying that i am at least good for  waiting on its arrival before doing the trip for returnreplacement just in case that one needs to go as well maybe just bad luck but definitely worth noting for anyone who may also be inconvenienced by having to do a returneverything else seems good though when you can look past the display issues but may be worth waiting until these defective lots have been disbursed and the issues have been correctedi am sure if you dont have these display issues that the product deserves more than  stars but if you can see things from my perspective it is kind of difficult to recommend this to anyone for the time being if the display did not have these pixel issues i could see this easily being a  star recommendation if you do a little research you will see that there are definitely some lot numbers that are more problematic than others so this is not just a rare incident if it is for you and you plan to grab one from a brick and mortar location do yourself a favor and just boot it up before you drive home ,2.0,negative
i use these for my wireless mouse on my laptop not heavy use at all but i am replacing these batteries at least once a week i have to carry extra batteries with me and ive never done that before i used to go months with name brand batteries so its a dramatic difference ill use these up but i wont buy them againthat being said this is the worst amazon basics product that i have bought everything else has been outstanding so im really surprised at how bad these arei have the aas as well and those dont seem to have the same problem maybe these are just part of a bad batch,2.0,negative
despite what seems to be a great deal for a pack of aa batteries these arent great  stars only because of the deal as theyre for light use i use them only for my xbox controllers i understand that the life is different with gaming sucking up all the energy but ive put a pair in before and about  weeks later had to change them not to mention i have  controllers one has a grip so i switch between them often this means they should last longer since im not just draining the battery life on one of them overall not great for gaming or heavy use otherwise theyre nice backups ill have to compare these to say duracell but from past experience i dont remember having to change them so often,2.0,negative
would not buy these again i reluctantly gave it a nd star because the price was good but the batteries are pretty much  star these get pretty good reviews so i was excited about them then the kids kept coming back way too fast asking for batteries for their wii remote it didnt make sense to me until i tossed some in my blood pressure monitor that thing runs for many months or years on a set of batteries but not these only weeks with these i dont have any kind of meter or anything like that to check them but the proof is in the usageits awful buy something else with a brand name,2.0,negative
i was disappointed with these batteries i thought they were going to be a higher quality and work as well as the name brand batteries i bought these to use in my sons leapster gs explorers my sons do not play on them nonstop and they shut off on their own after being idle for a few minutes these batteries dont even last  days  hrs of use at the most because we cant afford to go through batteries so quickly i change them once a week its really sad that they dont hold up longer time to go back to brand name as it will save money over these and use some rechargables do not buy if you plan on using these for something more than a remote or clock,2.0,negative
ive always been a fan of the kindle ever since the first one came out over a decade againi was excited about this kindle due to the many premium features it showed  the allmetal finish highresolution epaper display backlighting extended battery life etci was significantly disappointed to see that amazon pushes ads through the kindle when you put it into sleep mode and throughout the store options additionally i was further frustrated by the fact that i learned there was a cellular version available direct from amazon but not through the store for such an expensive unit to have ads with no option to disable them seems unreasonable and like a ripoff additionally the fact that this only supports wifi not cellular or whispersync makes it even more of a drawback and something i would not recommend to a friend  stick with the cheaper versioni also found annoying problems trying to get my apple airpod earphones to work with this device pairing took forever to finish or work had to try three different times and if the unit sits for too long i found that i had to go through the entire pairing process again they were not automatically connected and synced the moment i had both devices turned on,2.0,negative
maybe i got a bad batch however with  batteries youd think if that were the case that some of them would work well and for me they have not the main way these are being used are in an xbox remote the xbox is only used to run netflix hulu and amazon video on our tv so i am basically using the game remote as a tv remote it is never used for playing video games that being said i am lucky if a set of  of these batteries lasts  days in this remote that is a far cry from name brand batteries i have bought i purchased these thinking they would be a great deal however going through them x as fast as other batteries makes them a worse value not to mention it is annoying to have to change them out so often i will use up the ones i already bought then i will not be buying any more,2.0,negative
i bought this to go with the toshiba k tv with builtin chromecast i bought from best buy its nice when it works but i had problems with it that caused me to return iti have a fire stick and it works great i leave it plugged in but it needs to be unplugged every few weeks otherwise it works fairly well the fire tv had to be unplugged after every use the screen would flash and sometimes there would be a popping sound if i left it plugged in for any amount of time then it would not work well i liked the voice search on it and alexa works great you can ask for the weather play music and presumably other things that the echo dot and tap can do just a side note you have to keep the button pressed when asking alexa to do somethingmaybe i had a defective unit maybe it was something else but ive had a paperwhite and a voyage that both died on me in similar ways ive never had a problem with the lower end kindles or fire tablets based on my limited experience amazon just doesnt get its higher end products right im still going to use amazon for a variety of things but i no longer trust them for the higher end products that they make and sell,2.0,negative
first bought it  days before it went on sale everywhere next store doesnt tell you about all the ads offers that come with it and you must pay  to disable them performance is slow keypad is slow am typing faster than it can register resulting in lots of typos watching movies is decent but sound could be better it drops wifi more than im used to have several apps that cannot be installed on it and a few that consistently crash good battery kifre but quite slow to recharge sometimes the keys stick and cant get out of something even with home key must restart thought this would be cheap temporary solution but this is better served by my  year old grandsoni got  worth of tabletcompared to the look and feel of my old ipad its like im still using a vcr and everyone else is on blue ray,2.0,negative
just got this today and have been struggling with a few things set up itself was pretty easy right oit of the box had no idea i would not have access to google play store beware there is a much more limited selection of apps available for this device browsing is slow even while in the same room with my modem much slower than my phone or my other tablet tumblr app though able to be downloaded malfunctions consistently will probably return this and get a more capable tablet but will give it another couple of days to get used to it before doing so,2.0,negative

the amazon fire hd  model is a great tablet for the price however the fire os offers limited abilities to the user personally i wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a fire tv streaming stick also the inability to use the google play store is a major set back if it werent for those two complaint id give this tablet  stars,3.0,neutral
the tablet seems to work well not as fast as some but not bad i found it was not as easy to find an antivirus product to work with the fire  as it was for other android products i will use this tablet for reading books instead of surfing the web,3.0,neutral
so far so good display is not as bright or clear as my iphone but then again i only paid  dollars for the tablet,3.0,neutral
these do not last nearly as long as a name brand battery so considering the costbenefit im not really sure if they are any better,3.0,neutral
good tablet but not as smooth as high end tablets its limited to amazon so dont expect to do as much as an android or ipad i like mine and will continue to use it i recommend using one if you can before buying,3.0,neutral
great sound it needs to be a little more sophisticated in responding to inputs for example yesterday i told it to play mexican music  didnt know any same with mariachi music could not play any odd,3.0,neutral
i purchased this for our goddaughter and while the price is amazing and the tablet is acceptable for low overhead use i set up the same tablet for my daughter and it is too slow for my use,3.0,neutral
i use this tablet for my daughter and i could only download youtube kids wished i would have purchased the one with more storage,3.0,neutral
bought unit on black friday as a gift its good thus far wish it was easier to get back to the home screen other than that i like the unit,3.0,neutral
the fire tablet has an android operating system but is not like using an android phone amazons software makes the tablet more cumbersome to use and the tablet will often freeze also you cannot download apps from google play you have to get them from the amazon app store there are several apps from amazon that you cannot remove even if you do not use them would not recommend without having amazon support,3.0,neutral
they are okay i thought by the reviews they would last longer but im only getting a little life out of them,3.0,neutral
the fire has a solid build is not horribly slow and has decent battery its major flaw today is the screen which is both low resolution and poor contrast with weak viewing angles it makes a fine cheap tablet to hand to some kids though for the price not bad,3.0,neutral
decent little tablet if you are not a game player tablet shuts down and i cant get it back on when i play games for long periods of time its not my ipad thats for sure,3.0,neutral
the product would be great if it was easier to find the setting icon and if amazon wouldnt charge you a  for downloading applications that are labeled free the one dollar is automatically charged by amazon but you can dispute it with your credit company,3.0,neutral
good beginner tablet light enough for small hands to carry i got the cover as well which was a good investment as little hands tend to drop things not a lot of space but enough,3.0,neutral
bought this during black friday actually thursday ok for price but not cool i had to buy extra storage for not a great price,3.0,neutral
it is an ok product but the main reason for the purchase was because it was for a first time tablet owner it is very cheap in price but without a google play store it kind of sucks but like it says it is ok for the price,3.0,neutral
alexa is nice but it lacks a lot of informayion when asking questions its not like your smart phone that you can ask anything and will give you the answer only to certain thing and you have to email el certain apps in the alexa app itself to work still working on alexa so maybe that could be the reason but i though it would be like siri that you can ask anything,3.0,neutral
