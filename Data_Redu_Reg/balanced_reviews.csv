Do not last near as long as other 'off brand' batteries,1.0
"This 7"" 2015 version should have been marketed to children only. It's like a very ""dumbed"" down, cheap version of the better FireHD and HDX. Screen is not as good, battery life is bad, no mirroring to TV and it's slooowww as can be. If you've never owned another kind of Kindle you will probably be accepting of this watered down version. For those that know what a real kindle should be like, you may want to pass on this one. Another version should be along soon and since they can't get much worse than this one you'll probably get a better one. I got mine on Black Friday for a little over $30. total with shopping discounts and I'm still sending it back! That's how disappointed I am with it.",1.0
These batteries die almost as fast as Harbor Freight free batteries. I expected top quality and got bottom quality.,1.0
"The first time I buy my first tablet it came on but it only showed that it needed to reeboot, it then shut off by its self.",1.0
Tore within one week and is baby blue and very shear not green.,1.0
I bought 2 of these on Black Friday and these have to be one of the worst buys of my life!!!! The screen saver can't be changed so my kids are forced to look at ads every time they want to use their tablet. Apps are ok and to be honest I could have dealt with the ads but the final deal breaker for me is the sd card. I bought my kids sd cards so they can have more than 4 games and the tablet doesn't read it or something. It says sd card inserted but it won't download apps to the sd card!,1.0
"Slow, advertisement plagued. Save and spend money on something better.",1.0
"I got two of these batteries with my Fire TV stick. Loaded them in and everything was good for 1.5 days. Then the Fire TV stick stopped responding. I trouble shooted with no fix. Called customer service and they had me trouble shoot too, started by saying can you change the batteries.... my response ... seriously, you want me to change the batteries, it's a freaking TV stick what could possibly be wrong, the batteries are brand new and came with the device. So I was changing the batteries as I was saying all that only for the new batteries to fix the problem. So.... these amazon batteries died in 1.5 days. How does that happen",1.0
"Shame on Amazon for putting their trusted name on this garbage! Nothing I put these batteries work properly whether AA, AAA, C or D, not the blood pressure cup won't fill with air before going into Error, motion lights that flicker when these are put in, remotes that work on and off - which all goes away with name brand batteries!",1.0
They do not last at all! I never leave negative reviews as I am generally satisfied. But logged back in just to do it! They are awful!!!,1.0
This product is real bad from amazon. Although i dont expect much from a cheap tablet however this was even below my expectations. Its way slow to respond to anything or everything. My 3 year old goes after my ipad when i give him this....wont recommend to anyone.,1.0
"As soon as i place the new battery in my card alarm, ut says 1 bar charged",1.0
I ordered these thinking they were rechargeable (I recognize the error on my part but that is not my complaint here) .. so when I received them and used them I was not surprised that they died VERY quickly. Upon attempting to recharge these I figured out they aren't rechargeable (Once again big duh on my part)..Now I'm seriously surprised that I'm only getting a few hours of use out of them!! like a quarter of the use that a typical battery should offer. Horribly disappointed.. I will go back to the name brand batteries for sure.,1.0
This product wouldn't turn on nor charge and then store couldn't locate another one for me.,1.0
"I put two of these batteries in my wireless mouse and in less than two hours use, they had burned up. The mouse quit working and I went to check the batteries and they literally burned my fingers trying to get them out. I will throw the rest of them away and NEVER buy these again.I know I'll never get my money back. I'll just write it off as a lesson learned.",1.0
My old kindle charger works fine - that wasn't clear when I bought a new kindle white. And now you want to charge me 6.95 to send it back. Forget it!! I'll keep the extra charger,1.0
"Very, very, very difficult to turn on and off, not sticky enough and kept falling down, complete waste of money.When I could get them on and they were sticking, the lighting effect was very nice however, the quality of the product was zero.",1.0
"All I can say, as soon as I opened this tablet it never ever turned on, I was so upset as I've followed the troubleshooting steps from other users online and still it never worked, I fully charged the tablet and tried again and still it never turned on. I had a very hard time at the best buy returning this item; had to spend an hour and explained the situation to them; they never believed me this item came to be defective; after storming out and after a while; they have decided to accept the return and gave me credit for it.I would never buy an Amazon product ever again. piece of junk, bad quality product.Thanks,",1.0
"Worst batteries I ever bought. Less than one hour after installing in remote, popup on tv said remote battery low. Left them in and got about four hours more use before it wouldn't turn on the receiver. The AA's I bought seem to be fine. Not sure why the AAA's didn't last. Put 4 new ones in the remote ... we'll see how these do. The second set of four were no better than the first. Low battery warning after a few hours use (surfing dish tv program guide). All showed just over 1.5 volts before installation. Checked again when first low battery warning came up. Down to .8 volts. Guess I got an old, bad batch. Nothing but Duracell from here on out. Would not recommend these batteries !",1.0
This review can not be valid due to the device did not work for me. I would put it down. Just upgraded to the ECHO instead of the tap.,1.0
"I purchased one as a Christmas gift. from Best Buy on line...it worked fine the first month,did not use it for a few weeks. I went to turn it on..did not get nothing .The lefthand bottom corner says ""FASTBOOTH mode"" It is locked on this and I get nothing else.Did not buy any product protection so I guess it is a complete loss.",1.0
I was excited about the Amazon echo. However after getting it home setting it up and finding out how limiting it is that excitement went away fast. The echo couldn't answer the majority of questions or would be asked a question and instead of answering it would play country music which I never asked for.Unless you have smart home features like a smart thermostat or smart lights etc it is useless aside from being a speaker which for the money it isn't a good speaker.I did however try it for a week finding it not worth it or that googling questions was easier to answer. Even asking it about what movies were near me etc was a pain. Some said maybe I got a defective unit which wasn't the case the echo is just limited in what it can do.I would say save your money this isn't worth it yet.,1.0
"DO NOT PURCHASE! These batteries leaked in a machine I was using in my kids room to project stars on the ceiling. When I picked the projector up, it leaked battery fluid on me and burned my arms and legs. It could have gotten on my children! The leaking fluid also ruined the projector.The batteries were new, stored at room temp, used at room temp, not recharged, and not exposed to any fluid or abnormal conditions. Disposing in the appropriate manner.ETA: I was VERY happy with Amazon's resolution despite this bad experience. Thanks Amazon... I'll order batteries from you again. Just not your brand...",1.0
"I waited a couple months to review giving Amazon time to make this product equal to the SONY Dash from nearly a decade ago, it isn't the screen provides nothing of value and you can't turn of amazon tips! you have near zero customization can't even move the clock to the other side of the screen. And something that a sony dash did nearly 10 years ago pandora or prime music as an alarm! seriously this is the biggest fail! Run away from this half baked Amazon disaster!",1.0
I updated my credit car d more than six weeks ago. I won't bother you in the future.,1.0
"Everything I had read was a bit confusing on how the Echo can control it.. but low and behold it has the Alexa service built into it. The Echo CANNOT control the Amazon Fire TV which was the sole reason I bought it. Well.. also in hopes that HBO Now would have Surround Sound on it, but of course it didn't. So they're both at fault here and the reason why I returned it immediately. Since neither of the above worked, this made the device completely redundant with my Chromecast.",1.0
Worst batteries ever. I use them in my remote and have to switch them every couple of weeks. Do not buy,1.0
Never knows answers to question or has the song I want. And always says not getting connection. It sucks,1.0
"Very Poor battery life... Did not even last 30 minutes in my device where I've had top notch Energizer batteries that lasted weeks if not months!!!These just do not compare to top of the line batteries. Maybe good for a TV remote, but that's about it.",1.0
I feel like I have been completely lied to about this device. Despite reviews claiming a hands free mode that does not exist in the settings. I just downloaded the app for the first time today and there is no hands free option to enable in settings. And Pandora said it's not available in the US on this Amazon tap. Thanks for ruining a birthday Amazon,1.0
"This is exactly like any other usb power charger, making it unnecessary. A basic charger used for an ipod works to charge the kindle fire within 3-4 hours.",1.0
Our daughter loves the size and portability of the product. Her iPad died and she uses her Mac book for school so this was a great choice for her to read books on.,1.0
It's 2017 no reason this tablet cannot produce clear 1080 or higher resolution. I get it it's cheap and for that it's good but it just feels cheap and omg so manny pop up adds.. Comeon amazon,1.0
"I bought these batteries to charge my insulin pump - a life critical device. After I started using them, I found my pump worked terribly and after testing all other variables, popped out the Amazon battery and replaced with a Duracell, and everything was back to normal. I won't use these again.",1.0
Wrong item.,1.0
These things only last about a week in a Roku remote I will not be reordering.,1.0
Dont have option for password ask you before buying apps once you authorized as allow its done.Not as many free good apps Like apple have it,1.0
"Four in the batch leaked and caused a mess in my charger and device. I threw out the remaining to avoid future problems. In addition, the batteries didn't hold their charge. I presume I must have received a bad batch based on all the positive reviews.",1.0
Wish I didn't buy these. Amazon does a lot of things well but batteries No. Not so much. These do not work for more than a moment. Lay the extra for name brand.,1.0
This tablet has little cpu power and is really only made to work with the Amazon Prime crowd. Not what I was looking for.,1.0
"Gave these a fair chance but the fact is they simply do not last as long as Duracells. I've gone through more than half of the pack I purchased and I am easily replacing batteries twice as fast for the same devices, same use. I won't repurchase.",1.0
You get what you pay for. They do not last very long at all. It's better to buy Duracell.,1.0
"Purchased for my Father In Law - this was the most frustrating experience. Not user friendly - not friendly at all. Stick with a name brand tablet - Apple, Samsung, etc.. Avoid this device at all costs.",1.0
Low quality batteries - they die after using a few times. Better to go with big brand name,1.0
"I have had mine for about 6 months, now 2 won't last mare than a week in my TV remote. Pretty annoying!",1.0
Worst batteries I've ever used. I used them in a sensor light. They only worked l l/2 months while my prior Energizer batteries had worked for 5 l/2 months. I can see why these batteries are so cheap. I definitely would NOT recommend them to anyone.,1.0
They don't hold a charge very well.,1.0
"Bought these for my kids for the holidays. No you tube app installed, so you have to find a 3rd party substitute. Ads pop up all the time, with an option to remove them for $15. Amazon states that since I purchased the tablet on sale for $15, this is how they can afford to compensate for that revenue. I would have returned them had we been able to find the receipt.Maybe a good product, but not for us.",1.0
Not sure why they won't recharge correctly. Second time this happened with Amazon. Going back to a brand name.,1.0
Horrible batteries. So far every battery we have used hasn't worked!!!,1.0
"I was super bummed about these! I purchased them exactly 3 months ago today. I only used 8 batteries when they arrived, and they have all started to die this week already. When I went to replace them, none of the unopened ones work! So to recap... they did not last long, and only 8 of them were even usable. Very disappointed as we are big Amazon users.",1.0
They don't work. Still to regular brands.,1.0
"These batteries are horrible. We depend on AA batteries for many wireless microphone and have found that brand-name batteries last about a month per our usage. We switched to Amazon basics to try it out when a subscription for our preferred brand was no longer available and have found that, under the same usage, these batteries last about a week. That's a 1/4 capacity.",1.0
Horrible quality. These last 4 to 6 days in an Xbox controller and maybe 10 days in a remote. Horrible quality.,1.0
"Just got this as a Christmas gift and it doesn't stand.. Nothing to secure it to make it stand.. You can get it to stand maybe to watch a video, but don't touch it. It will fall down easily. Certainly don't stand it and actually use your Fire HD6 with this cover.. You can't.. Falls right over. I feel really badly for the special person that bought me this. Waste of money. I had already bought my own cover, for a lot cheaper, that has more shock protection and that one won't stand on end, but at sits securely at a tilt which makes it more useful for me. The cheaper one I bought on Amazon also has a magnetic closer to the cover stays closed. This one does not. Not sure how to tell the person who bought me this that I don't like this one at all. I'll feel bad telling them, and they'll feel bad hearing it. Bad all around.",1.0
"Disappointed... In my handheld Microsoft wireless game controller these last about 1 week. Duracell/Energizers last 3-4 weeks... Amazon needs to select a higher quality re-branded battery to sell as Amazon Prime. Amazon could dominate this market by simply selling, close to these prices, a 5 longer lasting battery than Duracell. DON'T PUT THESE IN ANY EMERGENCY DEVICE... like smoke detectors, emergency flashlights and radios.",1.0
Half of the batteries received were dead and there is no replace option.,1.0
"Hated it ! You have to purchase everything from Amazon ! Took it back within a couple days! Got the roku ,,,,, way better !",1.0
These batteries do not last or work well. Spend the extra buck and buy Duracell.,1.0
Trying to contact seller. Product very tarnished and rusty like it's been used or very old. Very disappointed by appearance and quality,1.0
Both packs were useless. Confirmed low charge with multimeter.,1.0
First day after purchasing the tablet the screen turned green. Since then it has given us problems with the screen turning green. I will be returning the item.,1.0
"Used it for a mouse - works OK. I have a battery powered egg beater and when I put these batteries, the beater did not perform at full speed. I had some Duracell batteries which I used and it was back to life!!So, I guess these are low powered, Very disappointed",1.0
You need gooooood wifi for this. If the wifi isn't good like it's in and out this will not work that good. You also need the app to set up alexa. I would only recommend this if you have great wifi,1.0
These batteries are not lasting at all.... very short life on them... super disappointed...,1.0
Stopped working in less than 3 months.,1.0
This doesn't power anything. I got this for my dad for Christmas and we just thought his Kindle was bad..nope..tried it on other things and it won't charge anything...I want my money back or a replace meant...maybe this unit is just bad! But 20 bucks down the drain!,1.0
"Can't believe Amazon's name is on these pieces of dung. Very short life. I've migrated to Eneloop rechargeables for AAA as well as AA now big savers, as I have a lot of doodads.",1.0
Great deal price wise but don't seem to last very long at all. So really not a good deal at all. Would not buy again.,1.0
Am used to Kindle Fire which I love. No light to read by in the dark. Hard to navigate. This was a gift - would never purchase on my own.,1.0
That's crap,1.0
"Easy to use, load books and to read in out door light conditions. Very light to hold and read.",1.0
Batteries were weak and didn't last a week in remote,1.0
I tried recharging them right out of the box and it says they are bad! I'll by my rechargeables elsewhere,1.0
Bought two of them first one would not charge after the first day. The second one The screen went blank so I have to return it now only after a couple of days of use. Will not purchase any more of this kind.,1.0
"was cheap, can not run chrome stuff, returned to store.",1.0
"I've had amazon tablets in the past and this is the far worst I've bought. It was slow, drained the battery, kicking me out of the apps all the time.",1.0
"I didnt like it from the begining because it isnt very ergomatic. It was easy to hit the wrong button shocking your dog when it was last set to vibrate. It was veru easy to push buttuns so you cant put it in a pocket. Then a week into use while replacing a probe, I hand turned to tighten it and the prope broke with the scew end broke off level and no way to get it out. I bought a product that had a different control style (so many manufators use the same controler design) and i hsve no problems with handling this one. Another problem is that the reciever can be shook off the collar the more it is worn. We lost the reciever after a few weeks. It might be ok if your dog is a fast learner and plan to use it for just a few days.",1.0
These batteries are crap. Last a few days in xbox controller. Energizer lasts months. Don't waste your money.,1.0
Batteries dead as of June 1. I did not use half of then. Good for 6 months.,1.0
"Ordered these for my son's remote control truck. Put them in both trucks and within a week the batteries in both trucks exploded, ruining both of them. So not only am I out the money I spent on the batteries I have to buy a new truck that costs 50. Spend the extra money and buy Duracell!",1.0
"This thing is garbage! Do not buy! It is the slowest charger I've every had. It is NOT a fast charger. It is a disgrace that Amazon is offering this product as a fast charger, and discontinued the previous all black square, blocky fast charger which really was a fast charger. This thing is NOT a fast charger. Save your money. Amazon needs to seriously check their supplier, the manufacturer of this junk.Advertising this thing as a fast charger is totally deceptive.",1.0
"I am reading positive reviews and wish I could say the same. Best Buy is great, so this is not a reflection on them, just our experience with the product. We have had this product for just over one month and I have had to contact Amazon Support, perform factory resets to get content to show up, and the device is poorly designed as the SD card pops out constantly, which messes with DRM, and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the Internet to fix it. We are returning, and spending the extra money for an iPad. Will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience. If you just use the device for reading, maybe this is for you, but trying to download information to SD card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating, as well as having to do factory resets so content owned/ already purchased on Amazon would show up on the device in the library.",1.0
"Ouch. I bought this Fire tablet, and used it for about four hours, and left it on a charger. A couple of hours later, I picked up the tablet, and the screen was showing a weird 'ghosting' effect, and then the screen went completely black.I twisted the chassis and screen a bit and managed to get things working again, just long enough to do a factory reset and return the tablet.I'm sure I had a defective/damaged tablet, but I was underwhelmed with the quality, and it would be nice if Amazon brought back the higher quality HDX tablets, for people who don't mind paying more for quality tablets.",1.0
"The Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet no longer was able to charge less than six months after being received as a Christmas present. I contaced Amazon, assuming that the was a one year warranty. Amazon tech support navigated me through a number of trouble shooting steps and concluded that the Usb port is defective. I was then told that this product only has a 90 day warranty and the best they could do in give me a 10% on my next Amazon purchase! Wow!",1.0
Batteries last for about 2 days in my Xbox one controller.,1.0
"Ok for kids to mess around with, but not very good quality",1.0
Batteries leaked when in charging station.,1.0
Was very disappointed to see that one of my batteries corroded and leaked in a device within only a few days of placing it in the device. Will not purchase again.,1.0
It's very tin sounding no bass sounds terrible bought a bose sound link and a amazon dot to hook up to it,1.0
"Some work, some don't. Some will power my TV remote but the same batteries wouldn't power a different type of remote. I won't buy these again.",1.0
"If you don't care about live tv this will do great for you. Otherwise, can't ditch the cord yet.",1.0
We are unable to connect WIFI on this product. We have tried to follow the instructions to no avail. It is a useless and expensive item sitting on our table.,1.0
Pretty dumb that you have to.buy a charger port,1.0
almost most of the batteries drained out in 1 or 2 weeks with moderate use,1.0
More then half did not work :(,1.0
Review is based on the fact that I have not able to make a connection with the device.,1.0
"purchased it tonight, time is wrong, you cannot change time manually because it has to have wifi to update the time.....AND IT WON'T CONNECT TO ANY WIFI THAT NEEDS A PASSCODE OR PASSWORD BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE CORRECT TIME!!!!!!! THIS IS 2016 TECHNOLOGY AMAZON? I've had many devices, but none that make you find a WIFI without a password (hard to do because starbucks, hotels, etc. all need you to click to agree to their terms for wifi...) all because the time cannot be changed without wifi!!!Returning it tomorrow!!!!!P.S. ALSO AN ISSUE ON THE AMAZON FORUMS, SO I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE DEALING WITH THIS!",1.0
"I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn't even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I'd be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it's a ""known issue"" and ""they're working on it"". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they're obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I'd look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it's unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. Sorry Amazon, not this time!",1.0
I got a bad batch. 4 of them arrived dead. I would have sent them back but I missed my window.,1.0
These last about 5 hrs in a roku remote using the headphones. Really disappointed in how long they last.,1.0
"No reason. This product is described as 5W, 1 amp. The Kindle line is mainly 5V (4.8V, what's the difference) and around 1 amp, which is 5 Watts (5W). Why the mystery, guys Also, this deal is for US 110V market only I travel. I like that the previous simple FIRE charger was universal (i.e. 100V-240v). I like that the first Kindle charger was also universal. What are you people doing Or, is it that the copywriter in this case just doesn't understandFor those who don't understand the details of electricity, ANY device will tell you what it needs to feed. Voltage (V) is one thing to look at and your charger needs to say something within the range of 100 and 240 volts to meet your device need. As far as AMPS (A). If your device says it needs 1.8 A. It's perfectly fine to buy a charger that has a rating higher than that. Like 2 Amps. The device will only drink as much as it needs. A device that needs 1.8 A plugged into a 2 A charger just means the charger is taking a nap. Just avoid situations where your device needs more Amps than a charger can provide. It won't necessarily explode but it will extend charge times and is generally not recommended.",1.0
Very poor batteries. I ordered a box and so far about 50 are either bad out of the box or very soon after.,1.0
Second purchase of an amazon battery product and just as disappointing as the first. Batteries don't last very long and they quickly leak battery acid. Installed for less than 1 year and already leaking in two separate devices stored in different conditions. Will never buy amazon batteries again. Definitely not worth the few dollars saved.,1.0
Right out of the box it didn't work. We took it back and the Geek Squad couldn't get it to work either. Great disappointment for my 9 year old boy since it was a Christmas gift.,1.0
"Lasted for barely any time at all. I have no idea why some batteries last longer than others but I can attest that these were stored in the exact same condition in our home as another brand of battery and the Amazon ones lasted for far less than half the life of the namebrands. I'm always willing to give Amazon products a try, but these batteries left a lot to be desired.",1.0
I opened up this package fresh and put two AA batteries in my Xbox one controller. It only lasted for a few hours of gameplay. When I took the batteries out they seem quite warm. I used my heat gun and they were 115F. I got a new set of two batteries and placed it in my controller. They only kept the controller on for less than a minute. When I took the batteries out one burned my finger. I grabbed my heat temperature gun and in certain spots it registered over 127I'm not going to try and use anymore in any electronics. I'm not sure what's going on here Amazon.,1.0
"Purchased these 3 months ago in addition to a higher end () brand that came with a 9 docket charger. The higher end rechargeables are still going strong. These leaked battery acid all over my charger and ruined one docket, and ruined an under cabinet puck light. Save your money! They won't last!",1.0
"From the minute you turn it on there's advertising. The OS is very different from a standard tablet OS - I couldn't get an app that I wanted from the Google Play Store - it just wouldn't work on this. As I said before, I found the amount of advertising just ridiculous.",1.0
"I totally love the Kindle Fire tablets purchased for my grandkids. My sister purchased one in our hometown for my mother. She is equally happy. My granddaughter and grandson spend their wind down time in the evening on the tablets playing their favorite games. In addition, they want a dog and conduct research for the type of dog that the would like. Overall, the tablets are easy to use and provides technology for them when they visit every other weekend. I am pleased.",1.0
Dangerous,1.0
"If I could give it a lower rating, I would.This is nothing more than a speaker, and a big one.It is NOT wireless so you cannot even take it outside w/o a power source. You cannot ask questions and have Alexa search answers. Very expensive. Would like to try google but since I cannot return this - I can't justify the price. Everyone said give it time to like Alexa. I gave it too much time and did not realize you had to return within a time frame (my bad).",1.0
"When you buy bulk batteries normally you open a box and have a bunch of batteries. With amazons frustration free packaging you open a cardboard box and find pain, hardship and loathing. I sprained a wrist trying to get the batteries out of the individual 4 pack space age metal plastic wrapping. It's terrible. It's also the first amazon product I didn't like. The first terribly packaged amazon product I've ever seen.",1.0
These batteries are absolute garbage. Very little capacity.,1.0
"The touch and loading the content is very bad, it doesn't respond quickly and it very slow",1.0
Not worth a crap don't waist your money. I purchased these for under cabinet lighting and they hardly have enough power. The light is way more dim than other batteries.,1.0
"I purchased this firetv to upgrade my from first firetv version as I have a samsung 4k tv, this new firetv recognized my hdmi port as 4k compatible when I set the resolution to 4k on video settings, after trying all posible settings, this bug only gives 1080 even playing 4k content. firetv1=firetv2.",1.0
Did not work right out of the box; bad hard drive. Read other reviews that stated the same issue. Would not recommend to anyone. Save your money.,1.0
"I went through all 48 in less than 2 weeks. I can't lie and say they were awesome, when they were not.",1.0
Don't waste your money. They last about 2 days in a wii remote.,1.0
This batteries have been disappointing. Use them for holiday decorations and some of the items that used to go for weeks are not requiring batteries every couple of days.,1.0
"Just purchased in October and replaced the batteries in my camping lantern this past week using these. The batteries leaked inside the lantern so badly that it wrecked the device altogether. I attempted to clean the contacts and use a different brand batteries, but enough battery acid leaked that the plastic and internals have a permanent coat of oxidation on it. Had to buy a new lantern. Do not plan on purchasing again in future as the batteries are ineligible for a return at this point.",1.0
I will not purchase these again. They last about 1/2 the life of the Duracell ones.,1.0
Ive gone thru half the box. Everyone of these batteries lasted for about 10 minutes and then died. Not happy at all! Wasted money on something i needed.,1.0
"received the wrapping paper thank you.but no batteries ever came,nor were they in the package with my wrapping paper",1.0
Bought this for my daughter(3) and she can't even use it because it is NOT kid friendly. It is so incredibly slow!! It freezes often and does not seem to work without wifi like it is supposed to. Also was supposed to come with a year free of Amazon free time and we have been charged for it every month !( it requires you to put a card number in before initial use. ) Keep calling Amazon and the foreign people can't seem to figure out the problem. Don't buy!,1.0
"It's very appealing for the price, but know in advance that the warranty is only 90 days... I did not. So when my sons device stopped charging due to a lose charging port a little over 2 months after he got it, I didn't rush to call. I have been taking care of seriously ill family members so I put customer service on the bottom of my list of priorities since I thought I had time,,, especially knowing that these types of calls can sometimes take hours which I didn't have. Today my son was home sick, so I had the day to do the things at the bottom of my list so I called Amazon. 52 minutes later, after doing all their trouble shooting steps THREE times and being disconnected once, she decided to tell me that my warranty was only for 90 days but she would be happy to help me buy one for only $49.99........ Ok. After I calmly explained to he that that was full price and I wasn't about to spend that again on a device that barely made it two months, she put me on hold and 5 minutes later she told me that they would generously give me $10 off my next purchase.Moral of the story, know before you buy & if you still buy, call the minute the thing breaks, even if that means your mom will be an hour late for chemo I guess.Also, during my 45 minute search for who to call about the defect (since it wasn't on the box) I found the Amazon support number on a thread with at least 200 other people talking about their defective charging ports. Keep that in mind.If $50 is something you can spend every 2 months, it might be worth it????",1.0
"batteries suck! brand new out of box dead or close too. Change smoke alarms every month and remote batteries every 2 weeks.junk dead, 3 different boxes and sizes of amazon",1.0
"3/4 of the package have been duds. Lasted about 15 minutes. Now I get to go to the trouble to return them. When you shop with Amazon, it's to save time. This defeats that purpose.",1.0
It's seems as thought all of the batteries in the package are already dead. They are only lasting 3-4 days in the devices I'm putting them in. Fairly disappointed,1.0
These batteries don't last half as long as the RayoVacs I usually get.,1.0
This device would be the best possible tablet for the money if it had Google Play. However Amazon chose to block access to it. This took their well made tablet with a beautiful screen and great performance from an amazing value to a waste of money. This is my last amazon branded product.If you use a lot of apps or want specific apps shop for another device.,1.0
All the batteries came dead so I did a return and got new ones. Second order was the same as the first.Update: still have yet to receive refund from second order after several weeks!!!,1.0
"Bought this for my Mom as a gift and was really disappointed. This device DOES NOT RUN FULL ANDROID. You cannot get third party apps even though they sell it as tablet. This device is only good if you only use Amazon (shopping, books, games), otherwise you can't download anything - not even a weather app. Not worth my money to be so limited - Returned the device and got the Lenovo Tab 2 A7 and we are MUCH happier with it!",1.0
This is useless. I have tried to calibrate it to my smart home. Pointless.,1.0
No longer takes charge from manufacture charger or any other type of charger. Product did not last very long since had 7 months.,1.0
During my first recharging they were leaking and wrapping was coming off. A waste of money,1.0
It wasn't what I thought it was the price was too much for what I got Very disappointed,1.0
"Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK",1.0
These batteries do not come close to duracel in terms of longevity.,1.0
"I purchased this tablet on a discounted price as an alternative for RC tablet. The operating system is not good, very slow response, apps takes a lot of time to open. Many of the apps like youtube is not made for fire OS, so my little one has a difficult time handling it. After 2 months, I got him RC tablet.",1.0
Do not pay attention to their ad. It says the plug is not included with the kindle and it absolutely is. If they lie about this sort of thing what else do you think the lie about. Steer clear these guys are rip off artist.,1.0

"I have bought 2 tablets for my son and didn't open it after I received it because it was a birthday gift for them and when they open it on their Big day 1 of the tablet didn't turn on ,the screen is just purple I m out of country right now and will be back on August 4,2107 and I emailed BEST BUY ""Geek Squad "" and told them the whole situation but nobody responded,very disappointed it was a surprise gift for my kiddos and 1 of my son was really upset that tablet won't turn on,let's see if Best Buy read my review and take some action !!!",1.0
"Could not download my books at home. Three visits to Best Buy, returned it.",1.0
"This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it.",1.0
We love it (that's me & my wife) . My son & daughter-in law & 2 grand-girls all love it.,1.0
"I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire tablets because the sales guy said that they were great and ran really fast. I have very fast internet and this thing just barely chugs along. If you play a game, it constantly stalls and freezes. The sound quality when I play music is terrible. I was planning on buying one for each of my 9 nieces and nephews if they ran well but now I know that wouldn't work for them because they are horrible.",1.0
"Im sure these are fine batteries, but they never arrived, and theres no way for me to request a replacement.",1.0
I love Amazon and Amazon products but....MAJOR disappointment. While not much less cost that Duracell or Energizer the Amazon brand batteries were a ripoff! Only lasted a third of the time in the devices I have used the competitor's batteries in before.....bummer :(,1.0
Great price but these do not last very long.,1.0
This device plays on the fact that you must subscribe to their stuff or this is just a empty cylinder that tells you the weather and that's it. And even then there is a subscription required for everything. Google Home at least plays general music lists and a number of other key actions.,1.0
"Worst batteries for photographers. I'm sure they might be fine for using around the house, but for what I purchased them for (using with my external flash) these are the worst batteries I've ever used.Won't purchase them again.The black ones that are supposed to be better are also horrible for photographers.Household use only.",1.0
The charger won't stay securely connected to the Paperwhite and wiggles. It will only charge when held at a particular angle.,1.0
Purchased two of these tablets. Both of them had 4-7 dead pixels all over the screen. Read a lot of online reviews which stated same problem. The screen/resolution is pretty bad but what can you expect for $50.,1.0

"These batteries wore out much too quickly. I almost replaced the weather station after it went through 2 sets of batteries in about 1 month. Luckily, something else with the same kind of batteries burned out the same day and I realized that the batteries were bad, not the electronics. .",1.0
"This thing has major connectivity issues, save your money and wait for a later version.",1.0
"The tablet would never turn on, even after charging",1.0
This is just a regular fire tablet that has protective case.,1.0
Don't last long at all. I've had better luck with cheaper batteries than I've had with these. Duracell batteries in the same equipment with same usage lasted 4 times longer than these Amazon AA Batteries did.,1.0
"I thought I was getting a deal when I saw these batteries. Unfortunately, they died after two weeks. I do not recommend buying this brand.",1.0
Entire pack of batteries was dead!,1.0
"Don't Buy! I thought it was a great deal initially, but these batteries are drained SUPER QUICKLY. I have one in my wireless Logitech mouse and I have had to replace the battery 4 times since November, that is 5 batteries in 2 months that is ridiculous! I have started buying the Duracell ProCell Batteries, I am having much better results.",1.0
Spend a few more dollars and get a branded one. These discharge very fast. Had to keep changing my wall clock battery every 2 months when I had these. Got an energizer battery and that stayed for more than a year. Didn't expect amazon product to be of such poor quality.,1.0
U thought it was going to be like an iPad or Samsung but it's all Amazon mode and you can't turn off the lock screen ads!!!! I get tired of seeing them...,1.0

"Very disappointed that my Kindle Voyage, purchased in April, failed after just two uses. Went to charge it tonight to take on a business trip and it won't charge, won't reset, etc. Since my Best Buy receipt says I only have 15 days to return it, tried calling Amazon support. Their only solution after over 30 minutes on the phone is to process a replacement which may be a new or may be a refurbished device-- unacceptable to replace a less than 2-month old device with a refurbished one... but, given the poor experience I've had with the Voyage, I'm not even comfortable with a 'new' replacement at this point. Amazon says they can't do anything about a refund because I purchased from Best Buy-- 15 days seems a little extreme in a situation like this with a defective product!Stuck with a $200 paperweight :-(",1.0
Bad performance. Slow device. Not worth buying. Better products are available in this range.,1.0
Not a long life at all. I bought AA batteries in the same order and they work fine.,1.0
"Worked great but after awhile I wouldn't unlock. After I'd enter my pin, the screen would go black. I took it to geek squad (luckily I bought the protection plan!) and told me they don't fix them they just replace them. So I got another one but that one did the exact same thing. Ended up returning that one too.",1.0
"The quality of Amazon AA battery is going down. Now just after a few weeks, even when it shows full power from battery power meter, the Amazon battery cannot be used in many appliances. (bluetooth keyboard, soap dispenser...)",1.0
"Terrible decision on my part to trust Amazon to make even a decent battery. How hard can it be, right Batteries don't last. Every device I've used them in began to have quirky little malfunctions (remote buttons don't always work or do what they are supposed to do, mouse randomly disconnects from computer, etc.). Maybe I got a bad batch -- all 48 of them. Lesson learned.",1.0
Spend the money and buy a name brand. These seriously do not work at all. Such a waste of money,1.0
Great Servive Best Buy and the price match is great I used it both at best buy,1.0

"I purchased this item on the recommendation of many existing owners. However, when I got home and attempted to set up the device, it was frustrating and the instructions/FAQs were not very helpful. The echo could not find my NEST thermostat, nor could it find about half of my HUE lights. Once I argued and fought with Alexa for about 45 minutes, she finally started to pick up my lights and after COMLETELY re-configuring my thermostat, she could see it, but she would not work with it. Once she found all of my lights, she would turn them on or off, but would not change colors or brightness levels. I run a software company and have worked in and with computers my whole life. This should not have been this quirky. I would not recommend this item. Get a Google Home.",1.0
The only reason I chose 1 star is because of size. The length is disproportionate to the width. Awkward when holding it.,1.0
They're not strong enough to power my kids' toys... so far they only work with tv remotes. :(,1.0
I came here to look at the one and two star reviews and see that people are saying the same thing I've been thinking since trying to use my first shipment of these batteries which are supposed to be better than the previous version that they replaced. I've used 3 of these batteries so far and each one has barely lasted 2 weeks in my mouse. The previous version usually lasted a couple months at least. It seems like in this day and age it's rare that when things are supposedly improved upon that they're actually better. I can only guess that Amazon found a cheaper supplier for their branded batteries. I guess it's time to cancel my subscribe and save subscription since I'm not the only one who finds these batteries to be subpar to their predecessors. If the rest of the batteries in this pack perform better I'll update my review to reflect that.***Edited to add on 10/12: Now that the 4th battery from this pack lasted just over 2 weeks in my mouse I will be contacting Amazon Customer Service. As I mentioned previously the older version of these batteries worked so well that I have to wonder why they changed them. I see the larger size Amazon batteries still carry the older name.,1.0
Don't last!,1.0
I have bought these several times thinking they were great but after longer term use have found they fail about twice as fast as Duracell. I will never buy them again and will not hold Amazon Basic in such A high standard. my next batteries will be Duracell,1.0
These go dead very quickly. Not worth it if you rely on whatever the batteries are powering. Maybe ok for a remote control or something unimportant.,1.0
Batteries must be old don't work!,1.0
"I bought this product from amazon about a month ago, the reviews seemed great so I gave them a try.After using the batteries in my Xbox One controllers for about 2 weeks, the controller began to malfunction.Upon further inspection, I checked the batteries, and the compartment was a little bit wet, so I cleaned it up and went to get new batteries (still in the plastic wrapper) and all of the batteries had an oily residue around them (some type of leakage) .Overall, dont save money here as you might lose your equipment and the money you spend on the batteries.",1.0
Didn't want to go to the sites amazon wanted me to.,1.0
Worst batteries ever. After m Duracell's in my wireless alarm keypad died after over a year I thought I would try these Amazon batteries. These batteries DO NOT last a week before they die and I have to replace them. Spend the extra money and buy the Duracell's they will same you money in the long run.,1.0
"Terrible. Don't hold their charge, I change the batteries in my remote once a week. Will not be buying again.",1.0

Last night (3 months later) I went to replace batteries in another remote and all 6 were dead.

Beware these batteries - I just packed them up for returning hated to have to do so but they lasted only 5 hours in tiny flashlights for my grand kids !!! Big disappointment too - won't buy this brand batteries again...nor do I recommend them to anyone out there !,1.0
"Gave these batteries a shot, because we've had great luck with AmazonBasics products. I just purchased the AAA and AA AmazonBasics batteries. These batteries do not last.

I have had a similar experience with the AA batteries on a wireless Mac keyboard. Would not recommend these batteries.",1.0

very good produ ct and service will defintely refer to a freind.,1.0
These batteries last 5 minutes. Waste of money.,1.0
you certainly get what you pay for....I bought these because the cost was about half of what I pay for name brand batteries. They last about 25 as long as the brand batteries. Hmmmm...paid half for something that lasts one quarter......My financial advisor is still wagging his finger at me,1.0
Did not work.,1.0
if you just want something basic cheap and cannot afford something better then it would be fine. But I needed it to do certain things that the other one was to small to handle.,1.0

"I suppose the most honest thing about them is in their name...BASIC!! I use them in my blood pressure monitor. I take my BP twice a day and it only takes about 10 seconds. The batteries only last about 6 weeks. I've also used them in my air conditioner remote which I might use once or twice a day, just to turn it on or off. Again, after about 5 - 6 weeks, they stop working. They are also used in my Alexa/Echo remote which is used more often, yet, they last about 3 months in it. This is the first Amazon labeled/made product that I have bought that was not rated a 5. Don't buy these if you are looking for a long lasting battery.",1.0

I bought this charger Nov 28 2015. It's now Jan 1 2016 (a little over a month later) and the device doesn't charge my kindle any longer. I have the kindle shutdown and allow it to be plugged in for multiple hours. After I take the charger off and start to use my Kindle within 30 minutes I see the Low Battery message. If I use the charger that came with my Kindle for the same amount of time I don't see the Low Battery message as quickly as I did with this charger. Not sure what's going on but makes me think I have a faulty device -- costs a lot of money for something that doesn't work any longer than 1 month,1.0

Also for those that were hoping to pick up some extra football via FOX sports network (FS1), that is not happening. You can add the channel free, but in order to watch any content you will still need a cable or satellite subscription which defeats the whole purpose of adding the app for us cord cutters. There is NO way I am signing back up for cable or satellite. I wish FS1 would get with the program and offer a separate subscription such as HBO and Showtime do. It's a thumbs down for me.",1.0

Batteries are something I don't test when i get them, I assume they will work when I need them. Have never had a problem before now. When to put 2 AA's in an LED flashlight..... nothing. Tried 2 more.... nothing. Tried 2 more....nothing 2 more (guess what)... nothing again. Tried it my TV remote too. Same results. Not something I would trust to stock up with for a power outage.While the product gets 1 star (that's too generous) I do give Amazon and their Customer Service 5 Stars.",1.0

Horrible. Amazon batteries are the WORST!!

"I understand you get what you pay for but come on Amazon. You make millions a day and you allow this product to be on your lineup. The only thing this tablet is good for is collecting dust.

I have used several sets of these for my AC thermostat which is battery powered and the thermostat died every few days when using amazon brand batteries. using Duracell or energizer - they last for at least a few mos. I will never buy amazon batteries again. You get what you pay for.,1.0
"My 37 days old Amazon fire stick quit working, the system was fine it just seemed like the remote wasn't getting any juice. Tried 3 different sets of these batteries in it and it still wouldn't work-and yes, I put them in the right way. Contacted Amazon about the limited warranty on remote as it was just past 30 days purchased and couldn't return, but before sending back for warranty service and being without TV for who knows how long and just to make sure, I bought some energizer batteries. Wouldn't you know it, the remote fired right back up. Can't trust these batteries.",1.0
"WHAT THE HECK! I have a SERIOUS issue with these batteries! I put them into my Amazon FireTV remote which kept draining batteries, and within a few minutes it quit working and gave up, thinking I had a bad remote. A few days later when I opened the case the batteries were had leaked all over the compartment.Just NOW, while typing on my keyboard, several of the batteries were sitting there next to my keyboard. I heard a hiss and felt a jet of air hit my right hand and I started coughing and choking on whatever the heck it was that came out of the battery.I'm throwing these away and will never trust this brand again.",1.0
I really wanted this as a Christmas present however it's nothing like the ads. Alexa works sometimes and then not. I can't get her to play music or listen to the radio through her. Very disappointed. Plan on taking it back.,1.0

"Will not stay connected to WiFi. When it is connected, device has to be within 6-8 ft. of router. Need this in the kitchen. Don't want to walk 25+ feet to use it. My other wifi devices work everywhere in the house as well as most of yard and garden. So I don't get it. Sick of looking at it - useless.",1.0
Most of these batteries either do not have any life left to them or they are die out after one use. terrible product.,1.0
They do not last long at all. I have to keep changing them out on the products I put them in. Will not be buying them again.,1.0
these are junk. you get a large quantity but they are not long-lasting and sometimes need to be changed after only a few hours of continuous use.i do not recommend these and will not purchase them again.,1.0
My son had the original kindle fire. It was great! Simple to use. It finally bit the dust. I bought a new one. They made it way to complicated. It is going back. The power button won't turn off. The notification box won't stay off the screen & the apps wont run. They just keep loading.,1.0
Bought a 20 pack to give them a try and found they dont hold up well in the tv remotes.... gone back to duracells,1.0
In Firestick remote it lasts about a week before replacement is required. Digging deeper alkaline batteries only last as long as they retain the upper percentage of their voltage. Either I have a bad batch or these degrade quickly in remotes. I plan on asking Amazon why this basic is so short lived in peak voltage retention.,1.0
Picture for proof. I had these in an Amazon basics wireless mouse and one of them exploded. It was only in there about 3 months before I noticed the batteries were dead. Upon inspection it was clear one of the batteries had a structural failure and exploded the end apart leaking fluid inside mouse.This mouse has NEVER been out of my air conditioned office.I have never had a battery explode inside a mouse before. These are obviously low quality. Do not put them into anything you'd be upset to ruin with leaky battery fluid.,1.0
Absolute junk! My devices run only 3 - 5 days with these batteries and probably half have been dead when I put them in my devices. Save your money buy Duracell batteries from Groupon they will stand behind less than quality batteries but Amazon will not once you buy Amazon batteries as has become the case with most of Amazon you are on your on without a paddle.Amazon did send me replacement batteries however they are the same as the original ones. I don't know how anyone can give a positive review just terrible.,1.0
"I had high hopes for these and very surprised at alt he high rating. I must have received a bad batch. This is a large qty and 6-8 months after purchase, using these batteries and they are no good. I figured they just wore out since i did not use them. Very disappointed and a good 20+ are trash. Real bummer.",1.0
"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!",1.0

Everyone read the 1 star reviews..the 5 star reviews must be people reviewing immediately. The 10 year promise is crap. I have 48 AA and 36 AAA batteries that are all dead after 1 year. The Dollar Tree batteries are better. Pay the extra money and don't fall for Amazons broken promises or guarantees.,1.0
"These are, by, far, the worst batteries my family has ever purchased. They have all lasted less than one week and I've only used them in things that see usage a few times per week. None of them have seen more than 10 min total usage before needing replaced and q about a third of them have leaked or corroded worthiness a few days. I've had much better luck with dollar store brands.",1.0

The kids were loving these as Christmas gifts but here we are 6 months later and the battery charging port barely even works. We have to hold the charging cable at a certain angle for it to even charge. I wasn't expecting a super long life out of these tablets at $39.99 a pop but should've lasted longer than 5-6 months. Very upset with 4 sad kiddos.,1.0
Very cheap and was not impressed at all never again,1.0
"Purchased for viewing Amazon prime. Loaded a couple apps and set it to sleep. When I returned a few hours later it was stuck in a perpetual boot and was not recoverable.

"I purchased 2 of these as Christmas gifts for our niece and nephew. We decided to unbox them and charge them up to be ready for Christmas day. After opening them, discovered they will not allow you to install any free apps or use them for much unless registered with an Amazon account and credit or gift card. I had absolutely no interest in giving a 4 and 7 year old access to one click shopping on my account so we returned these for android type kids tablets. There may be some way around this restriction, but I didn't find it.",1.0
"I have never had problems with the Amazon brand batteries before until this time around. I use these for battery operated candles and normally 3 AAA batteries will last in my candle a couple of weeks on a timer. I replaced the batteries 2 days ago with these batteries in 3 separate candles and all three candles do not work less than 24 hours later. Not sure if this batch was defective or not, but I won't risk spending the money and buying them again to not have them work.",1.0
Awful poor performance. My mouse ran for several weeks to several months from Duracells but have never gotten more that several days from these. Will not buy again.,1.0
"The item was on sale over the Christmas period at a great price. Took it home and when I charged it up, the back of the tablet became very hot to the touch and the battery life reduced dramatically. Left it alone, tried it again, this time no issues. Four days later, it did the same thing when I was charging it up again. Sent it back for a refund.",1.0
"Bought this for my nephew. The price is right, however, the tablet is terrible. Spend the money and get an iPad.",1.0
cheap - need to constantly make sure plugged in - slightly too small - saved some bucks there - not amazon quality,1.0

"to spite the fact that i have nothing but good things to say about amazon and anthing i've ever gotten from them. and that i love my fire. i find it greedy that the wall charger doesn't come with the kindle. not everyone, ok most people, but still not everyone has a usb port to plug into. i'm taking my charger back. i think amazon should make things right and let anyone who purchased a kindle without a charger have one for free, or credit those who had to buy one.",1.0
The battery life is much poorer compared to name brands like energizer and Duracell.,1.0
The supplied Amazon Bluetooth remote control will not pair back with the main unit. This is the second one I bought with the same issue. Re-Pairing the remote is quite simple per the instructions but to no avail. Had to use a android remote with a usb dongle to operate the unit.

Before you comment that it may be the user, I have set up every electronic device I have purchased for myself or my children (compters, cell phones, lap tops, game systems) This tablet would not connect to wifi.

This item is the worst ever a d the tech support is even worst. Spent hour troubleshooting and their solution was to return it to Bestbuy a d get anotherone. So i did. And guess what? It didn't work ether. Basically the Netflix app can't be downloaded becuse the Amazon Fire tv won't let you and to make it worst if you're a fan of HBO brace yourself becuase the app isn't even available on their app store. HBO simply doesn't exist. I spent in total 4 days troubleshooting with the Amazon team actually managing the Fire TV remotely from their offices and the answer was that ether the equipment is defective or that they don't have Netflix or HBO available for it. REALLY ITS FREAKING ADVERTISED ON THE BOX. DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY. better get an apple tv or a roku,1.0

"These are the WORST batteries I have ever encountered anywhere in my 46-year life! I am appalled that Amazon put their name on them I guarantee that if these had been my first Amazon purchase, I would never have done business here again. If they had not been wrapped in packs of 4 batteries in cellophane, I would have been certain that someone else had used them all up and then returned these batteries to Amazon.None of the batteries was anywhere close to full power - they couldn't provide adequate power to anything I tried them in for any battery-powered item to work properly. Candles and flashlights were so dim I would have required more of them than I am physically capable of carrying to avoid tripping over my own feet. None of the appliance remotes would even turn their respective appliances on after these batteries were inserted. Every item I tried these batteries in also stopped working completely due to a dead battery in less than 30 minutes.Obviously, I should have returned these batteries, and I'm sure I would have done so if my mom had not had a heart attack shortly after I received them. I am just grateful she is now doing so well that neither she nor her cardiac surgeon have to rely on any battery-powered device!!!",1.0

They weren't left in cold storage to freeze, they were right on the shelf in our living room. I ended-up going to Radio Shack and purchasing one of their batteries instead.I can only imagine that most of the 5-star reviews for this product are based off initial impressions and short-term use.

"Update 4/30/16:I've been trying to use up the last of the batteries and two more have been found leaking acid since the previous review. I didn't want to just throw them out but at this point is isn't worth the mess and damage to devices.Original Review:Bought two packs of these on subscribe and save in the last couple months. We play laser tag and the guns require 6 batteries each so I thought this would be a good source of cheap batteries for our 8 guns. I put these in about a week ago after having the batteries sitting on a shelf for a couple months. We played a game and then put the guns up. The next time we played ( about 3 days later) I noticed an oily liquid running out of one of the guns. The battery was leaking acid and it had run out of the battery compartment and was all over the outside.I get that it happens to other batteries as well, but that's usually after sitting in a device for months, not a few days. I would not trust these in anything expensive...and take them out immediately after use. I won't buy again. Sorry, no pics...I was busy cleaning up the mess.",1.0

I think the Amazon ones go for just a bit over .20 each. I think the Duracell's last more than a third longer.",1.0
I don't know why but these things don't last long. Maybe I don't know anything about batteries and there is certain number I should be looking for to determine the life span.

"I bought this for my 3 year old, so she would have another option for watching her shows besides my iPad. Needless to say, she was too frustrated with the slowness to load the Netflix app, and it would only get internet if you were in the same room as the modem. You really do get what you pay for. If you buy this, don't count on getting online very seamlessly. The Internet browser is really slow to use, but you can get around this by downloading Google Play store to access the Firefox app, which is not offered on the Amazon App Store. Check YouTube for instructions..",1.0

Looking at the picture and seeing it was 8th generation I assumed it would be a great device. I had an original Kindle but I stopped using it because it wasn't backlit. I thought an 8th generation would be backlit and the picture makes it look backlit but it is not. After 25 minutes on the phone with Amazon trying to make it brighter the technician finally realized that 8th generation is not supported with backlights. I took it back to Target and purchased The Paperwhite which was more money but definitely worth it. The 8th generation one is smaller so I assumed that was the reason for the price difference. Target made the experience pleasant.,1.0
These batteries are awful!! I usually use duracell AA in my small Christmas light strings and they last me 2.5-3 weeks with being constantly on. These have lasted about 4 days with the same use. I read other reviews which stated they were the same but it wasn't until I put them in my normal light strings that I saw the difference. Will NOT order again.,1.0
"I have never been so disappointed with a product. The battery life is horrible. When used in my camera, I can get maybe five standard-non zoom pictures before the camera shuts down and states the batteries need replaced. When used in tv remotes, the battery life is maybe a week. It is the same with the Amazon AAA batteries too. I will not be repurchasing again.",1.0

I ordered a ton of these for holiday candle lights. They are in for 6 hours each night and turn off on a timer. We are 15 days in and every single candle (34 of them) is so dim you can barely see them.Expected to get far more life out of these. Do not recommend.,1.0
"Let's be realistic on two fronts about the Echo: (1) I'ts fun to play with, a novel idea. (2) There are some serious flaws and if you doubt me you can try these yourself. Ask Alexa these three questions:(1) ""What is the Customer Service Number for UPS?"". You'll be told the phone number of your nearest UPS store. No matter how you phrase the question.(2) ""Alexa, what is the current humidity outside?"". You'll get the days weather report no matter how you pose the question. Seriously, it cannot even provide the Humidity?(3) ""Alexa, Who makes the 747 Jet?"". You'll hear ""Hmmm, I'm not sure what you meant by that question. So throw in a clue with ""Alexa, who makes the Boeing 747 Jet?"" and you'll hear the same answer. And this product is alleged to go out to the web to pull down information from Wikipedia, et al?(4) The reproduction of music is egregious at best. Read anywhere on the Internet and you'll see this mentioned time and time again. It's very, very bad. Imagine a 1960's Transistor Radio not quite tuned well..(5) The voice quality sounds like something from a Commodore-64 back in the 1980's. Another very common complaint you'll read about in reviews.This is going back tonight. Not worth the $179.00 and I feel it's slated to go the route of the Pet Rock (for those who remember it).",1.0

"I bought this to replace a 3-year old Kindle Fire 7"" HDX that I had just dropped on the floor. I sort of panicked, so after doing a couple of hours of research I picked this tablet. Just to be on the safe side I got 16 additional GB of memory. I installed a couple of games (none of them memory hogs) and a cookbook app, in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries. I can honestly say this is the slowest tablet I've ever had. Just rotating the screen takes 7-10 seconds, and that's if there's only one app open. Opening a book or magazine can take half a minute, and God help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while you're cooking! Amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers. Since there are no other Fire tablets available for whatever reason (maybe they're being discontinued?) I'll be replacing it with either an iPad or a Galaxy tablet.",1.0

"I purchased them thinking they would be a great value, based on other reviews. I have an alarm keypad (among other things) that I use them in. Previously batteries would last about a year in the keypad. These batteries will last about a month before they die. The first time it happened, I thought there could have been a bad battery or possibly my memory was failing me. After 3 sets in 3 months, there is no doubt. The batteries test fully charged when I install them and then a month later they are gone. That is not a great value at all. I will find another battery for future use.",1.0
I'm a huge fan of amazon so I figured I'd give these a shot. These have no life whatsoever. Even something as low-power as tv remotes they only last about 2 weeks tops.Spend the extra money and go with name brand.,1.0

Brought it to a Bestbuy store to exchange, but custumer service won't replace it. Asked me to look on the kindle shelf and there was none. Then they said they could give me store credit, and I would go line up in checkout and order a new one. Since I got mine on a discount, I had to pay the price difference!! This is ridiculous. They wouldn't order a replacement for a defective product, unless I pay more?? Got a refund in the end even though I liked the product otherwise and would much prefer an exchange. I guess purchases with discounts are not protected.",1.0

"These are the worst batteries I have ever come across. I just discovered today that mostof the batteries I was sent were dead.

Both devices were operated under the same conditions. I tried putting new Amazon batteries into the devices, and the devices didn't work I tried putting another set in, same problem. I then placed Energizer batteries into the devices, and they work.

"This is the first Amazon product I've purchased. I thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really can't be much difference between alkaline batteries.I am a working musician teacher. I sing with a band and use a Shure Wireless Beta 58 mic. A normal set of alkaline batteries last about 7-8 hours in my mic. The first gig I used these with was about 3 1/2 hours with the mic on and by the end of the gig the light on the mic showing battery was showing that the battery was about to die. I was just lucky that it lasted long enough for the entire gig. Usually I can get two full gigs out of an alkaline battery. Just as a comparison, I usually buy the cheapest boxes of batteries at Lowe's. Those batteries are only slightly more expensive than the Amazon Basics and last twice as long in my mic.I can't say how these batteries work in other things, but I can say that for what I use them for they are a big waste of money.

"Bestbuy came through before the holiday better than Amazon--item available, arrived within 2 days, competitively priced. Great service there. My problem is with disappointing performance by Echo. Siri wins over Alexa. Issues encountered:1) a skill will be installed, but Alexa will tell me first, I need to install the skill and second, that the skill is already installed. User is stuck in a do-loop with no response.2) access to quick 1-sentence read from Wikipedia is appreciated, but if you ask 'tell me more,' Alexa's voice is so rushed and computerized, some of the information is unintelligible.3) tons of skills, but so many of them are at a micro level and others are 1-time gimmicks. If you are not careful, you then need a skill to help you with all the skills you've installed.4) responses on some of the more interesting skills are just plain wrong. Vocabulary on word master is limited, so you will told your response is not a word that begins with ""X"" and we have had instances where our correct response on Jeopardy is reported as not correct. In one skill about a magic door (?) a clue is described, but when selected, you are sent backward a step with the same clue offered again. Frustrating and makes you feel you are doing something wrong or not speaking clearly. Children can get frustrated quickly.5) access to music is quirky.

Every single battery leaked battery acid after the first few charges or uses. Some while in the device it was powering and others while in the charging station. I thought perhaps it could be the charging station I was using so I purchased another brand but it didn't make a difference. I also never left the batteries in the charger once they were fully charged. This happened with the AAA batteries I purchased as well. And when I say leaked battery acid I'm talking about literal puddles of acid that would pool under the charging station or begin leaking from the device. I had to throw away a few children's toys as well as an xbox 1 controller. The skin on the tips of my fingers peeled away a few times as well from overexposure to the battery acid after having to clean so many surfaces and devices from it getting everywhere. Please don't buy this product They are completely ineffective and its simply an unsafe product.

My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis.Battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak Two pieces to keep up with; unsnaps constantly Amazon Customer Services promises it will resolved in an update,1.0
I bought these for my cameras. They don't last any time at all. I won't buy these again.,1.0
These batteries do not hold charge well. By the time I need to use it few weeks none of them work,1.0
horrible --- they barely last a week in my tv remote control,1.0
Buyer beware They say it's free tv...ITS NOT!You have to pay for everything! I wish I would have bought this before I cancelled my cable.,1.0
Too bad Amazon turned this tablet into a big advertising tool. Many apps dont work and the camera is not good.,1.0
Really expected a chord with it for the price we paid. Very dissapointed.,1.0
Not sure I will be buying these again. The first four pack I opened was dead. The second pack worked but only lasted half the time a name brand battery lasts. I am using more batteries for the same amount of use in my headset. I won't be buying these again.,1.0
"This is my 4th Kindle, and the worst so far. It randomly locks up and require a restart to do anything. I've probably had to do this a dozen times in the last week. It's going back if they'll take it.",1.0
"i bought two fire tv boxes and both of them have problems, the problem is that the remote suddenly stops working and then it comes back and works, sometimes it takes a few minutes for it to start working. That never happen with the roku",1.0
Terrible batteries!! They exploded all over my face. Received them on a Monday and that Sunday was having problems with my remote so I opened it up and was sprayed in the face with acid. Luckily it missed my eye. I have bought cheap batteries before and never had anything like this happen before!!,1.0
"I'm sure its a great product but there was something wrong with the one I ordered on target.com. My daughter opened it on Christmas morning and was so excited. We went to charge it and it wouldn't turn on. We tried holding the power button down for 40 seconds like the amazon website suggests, nothing, we left it charging for hours and still nothing. Very disappointed.",1.0
"bad product, not working in the remote car where it required 3 AA batteries.",1.0
"Sorry Amazon. You guys are great at what you do by selling your products at reasonable prices and good no hassle returns and I am a very happy customer. But I purchased a box each of your AAA, AA, and D Cell batteries. I have used the AAA's for remotes with no apparent problems so far. I have not used the D Cells yet, but the AA batteries are the worst batteries I have ever used. They don't last long in my flash lights. My son had four batteries that actually blew up inside the unit. I heard a loud pop while the unit was playing after five minutes or so. I wanted to know what happened, and looked inside the unit and the green - negative containment ring/sealer had blown out and acid was all over the inside of the unit. I had to throw the rest of these batteries in the trash because I am worried about my little ones getting acid on them. Amazon Your good name should not be on those bad batteries.",1.0
This is not what I received.,1.0
These batteries are very poor quality and do not last even half the time of standard Energizer or Duracell batteries,1.0
Can not print from this device...Using the touch screen is very difficult.,1.0
WORST batteries EVER. I thought there would be no appreciable difference between these and Duracell. I was wrong. Mouse was VERY sluggish and would sometimes stop working with these batteries. Replacing them with another set of these batteries did not help. My husband thought the computer had a virus. Problem SOLVED with Duracell. I will not be purchasing these batteries again. Amazon FAIL.,1.0
"Batteries die quicker than Dollar store batteries. Used these batteries on various products -toothbrush, computer mouse, camera flash, etc. Batteries at best lasted half as much compared to Energizer and Duracell. Would not recommend!",1.0
run out super quick! would not buy again,1.0
This tablet shut down and never turned back on after a week of purchasing it. I had to return it and they were out of stock for exchange. Annoying.,1.0
Very mixed bag of opinions about these batteries. My experience as that they are terrible. Amazon should never have put their name on such a poor product.,1.0
"Horrible, do not buy.I bought these in AA and AAA and they all lasted just a few days. My battery tester shows them on the lower side of good when unused but doesn't take long before they stop working.",1.0
"I bought this tablet for my mother 12/7/15 as a Christmas gift, which I gave to her on the day 12/25. Just this week 1/8 she called to tell me that the tablet was not working right. I went to see her and check it out. Sure enough it wasn't functioning properly. I'm hoping that when I take it in, it will be replaced without a problem. I know sometimes items are just defective. That's why I would recommend this item. I've had my Kindle Fire for 3 years now with never a problem.",1.0
About 1/3 the life of energized or Duracell batteries.,1.0
These worked for about a week. Then started leaking and just stopped working. I ended up throwing them away. I even had to throw a string of lights out because of the leaks of batteries.,1.0
"Absolute junk, don't waste your money. Bought for wife for a Christmas gift. Would not connect to Wi-Fi at my house. Useless!",1.0
Died almost immediately. Ruined their purpose for the purpose needed.,1.0
They paired these with a order that uses AA,1.0
Didn't realize until after we bought it that there was no google play.,1.0
these batteries don't last very long,1.0
They fail earlier than brand names. I assumed Amazon would match in beat others. I won't order again.,1.0
I find these batteries fail in a short time on items like wireless thermometers and wall clocks. On an average changing is required within a month. I would not purchase these again.,1.0
takes 30 minutes to connect to wifi and none of the apps work on it and i restored it 3 times already. Big and bulky. you will be better to get the more expensive model,1.0
I bought a Kindle Fire 16GB for my 6 year old son in June. After 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge. Best Buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it. Amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them! They have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if I buy a new one. Amazon does not stand behind this product. They are aware of the defect and continue to sell these.,1.0
These die way too fast.,1.0
"I've bought over 10 replacement charging wires, the ones with the micro mail end that inserts into the Fire to charge it. After one or two uses, the wires become loose and fall out. They definitely won't stay put to charge. Does anyone else have this problem? What's the solution? If not for this, I would recommend it.",1.0
"First time I bought these they worked well and lasted almost as long as the name brands. Not the same this time around, almost no charge - 4-6 hours of run time - Junk batteries.",1.0
These do not last long at all very cheap batteries no happy,1.0
"Shortest battery life I have ever experienced, using a Microsoft BlueTooth mouse that I have had for years, and have never experienced a shorter time between changing batteries than with these Amazon batteries! Duracell even Energizer or Maxell are far superior given my long decades of experience. Bah Humbug to Amazon on this one.",1.0
Out of every package so far only 2 batteries are working. I bought these in April so they should still all be good and I'm finding I need to throw most of them away. I wish I could still return them.,1.0
"These batteries are the worst. They leak and they die ridiculously fast. I've replaced the battery in my kitchen clock twice in the past month. They last about 6 hours of use in a Wii remote. I usually like the amazon basics brand, but these batteries were a total waste.",1.0
Worst batteries I have ever purchased. I use in the mouse to my laptop. Doesn't hold a charge for more than three days with limited usage (maybe 4 hours/day). Not worth the price.,1.0
"I picked this up on Black Friday when it was $30. It seemed like the parental controls would make it good for my kids. I'm not sold. While I can sideload the Google Play store, you can't access anything you download from the safety of the child's account. In addition, 8 GB is practically useless.",1.0
A waste of money. You don't need this. Just plug your tablet into your computer and the charge lasts for a month.,1.0
A lot of apps are incomplete. Doesn't run apps that great and has a lot of apps that are generic.,1.0
"So I was already not too pleased with Amazon's choice to only include an essentially useless charger when purchasing a kindle hd, and caved to ordering the fast charger so it would not take hours of non-use to recharge. For 20 you don't even get a full charger, just an adapter to put on to the cord they already gave you. Amazon please just charge the real price for the device instead of settling to slowly rip people off with essential accessories, this sort of thing cheapens your image and erodes loyalty.",1.0
I bought four fire tablets and each of them stopped charging immediately after the purchase. I wrote to Best Buy detailing the problem with the tablets and the fact I did not have insurance or the boxes to return the item. No response. Disappointed because I have made major and multiple purchases with this company. Won't make any more purchases from Best Buy.,1.0
Gave as a Christmas gift. Recently learned that it stopped working within two weeks.,1.0
"They were duds. I bought them before christmas so I could stick them in the toys and not one worked. I tried them on other items to make sure it wasn't the toys and not the batteries . Nope , it was all of the batteries. I only give one star for the reason I got them on time ....now I have a box of triple a batteries that don't work . so glad I caught that before christmas or I would have had disappointed children on christmas.",1.0
What went wrong These are the worst AAA batteries I've ever purchased. Make that the worst batteries ever purchased. I've used over half of them so far and I'm getting about 25 of the life I previously got from Duracell and other brand names.,1.0
"Terrible - The product lasts less than a week in a home weather station, regardless if warm or cold weather. Cheap Rayovac batteries work just fine and I will stick with buying those locally at Menards.",1.0
We bought this earlier on line from another vendor and it was never delivered. Best Buy was great.,1.0
"The batteries I got have very little charge left in them. 2 batteries only lasted 2 days in my Wii remote, whereas other batteries lasted weeks. V",1.0

we will never buy any more!!!! they suck!!!!!,1.0
"did not power up...at all. I am so happy that my grand-niece wasn't here and doesn't know about this yet, she would have been crying.",1.0
"Not as easy as it sounded like it was going to be. So many things to buy to get full use out of what we knew we COULD do. Every question we seem to ask Alexa/she says she doesn't know the answer and that we'd have to ""download the app"" - so we never use her/only to ask her to set a timer and tell us the time and ask her to play music, which we also had to set up first. Not as neat as we thought she was going to be.",1.0
"Of the 6 I used so far, out of the box and wrapper, completely dead... thanks...",1.0
By far the worst batteries I have ever bought I regret my purchase of 2 packs! Half of each box came without power and the ones that did were half life! If u found this helpful please rate helpful thanks!,1.0
Two batteries of he the twenty were leaking in the Package on delivery. With a ten year warranty against leakage...that is not a good start,1.0
"Utterly worthless, no staying power.",1.0
NOT MUCH POWER IN THESE BATTS,1.0
very disappointed in these!,1.0
"I didon't care for this tablet, downloading apps outside of Amazon was really confusing.",1.0
"I've had good luck with Amazon basics peripheral devices for computers, but the 24 pack of AAA batteries I got had virtually no power out of the package. Perhaps it's a quality control issue, but I got burned on the ones I bought, and won't take another chance with them.",1.0
"Unless you have fiber optic internet, don't buy this. If you have ATT Uverse it will mess up the TV, lower the speed of your internet, and play havoc with the phone.It has not worked yet since getting it, since I only have 25mgb of internet, and it really does not work at that speed at all.",1.0
qc is really bad on this product and does not catch the voice properly.,1.0
"Onsale is 39.99 is cheap , good for new stars tablet",1.0
"Worst performance in AA alkaline batteries we have ever seen. We bought these for use in our manufacturing company, and we used them in a wide variety of applications. Everyone has had poor performance. For clocks that used to have batteries last three years, this brand lasted only several weeks. Same problems when used in a computer mouse by several people, laser pointers, and other applications. We are going back to name-brand AA batteries. This is the worst rating I have given any product in a long time.",1.0
they let for about 5 recharges,1.0
"If I could give this 0 stars, I would. They all have problems working and the batteries have to be replaced after one use. Waste of time for what you get.",1.0
These batteries did not even last a day with some LED lights we used. I do not recommend these to anyone. Go with a good brand name.,1.0
Batteries do not last at all. Worth just getting energizer batteries instead.,1.0
I wanted solar batteries.,1.0
"The batteries were not operable out of the package. Thought it was the appliance, but replaced with other batteries and it worked fine. Luckily, Amazon's return policy is amazing but I doubt I'll try another one of their Basics brand items anytime soon.",1.0
Don't buy. Don't last!,1.0
Love the ease of using them for our grandsons and they enjoyed them for Christmas,1.0
I returned the item was not what I expected very disappointed white the table,1.0
These batteries are actually falling apart before we use them. They are junk,1.0
"Over the past few years, I have purchased Kindle Fires for various family members. The workmanship for those Kindles in abysmal. Two weeks ago, my Kindle Fire HDX shorted itself out. I replaced it with Amazon Fire 10.1. This device does NOT hold a charge for more than three and a half hours. You read that correctly!. I have been using it on a daily basis, each time it needs to be charged, it does a repeat performance. There is absolutely NO way that I will ever purchase any device manufactured by Amazon, ever again. I tell it like it is, if you want terrible device performance, opt for the Amazon product. If you need a reliable device, look at other manufacturers for the options you need.",1.0
Junk...save your money... totally useless batteries that last hours if that.,1.0
Maybe I received a defective batch but these are so bad.No longevity at all. Used up within 2 weeks whereas the branded ones last 2 months!I will not purchase them again regardless of the lower cost.,1.0
Basic performance didnt last a week in an AM radio.,1.0
they are terrible,1.0
Since I purchased returned couple of times now is dead I have to return it again. My first problem didn't paired.,1.0
"The batteries are sligtly bigger and will not fit in some electronics I thought AA was the standard size Nope, I was wrong, but the good news is I now am the proud owner of 48 slightly oversized batteries that do not fit in most of my battery operated devices. Perfect! Out of 9400 reviews nobody noticed the size issue with these",1.0

"I see that these batteries have lots of positive reviews. My experience has been poor. I put a pair in the sensor for an outdoor thermometer. They lasted about 2 weeks and when tested, showed very low power. Replaced them with a second pair. They lasted and tested about the same. These may work better in indoor uses, but they seem to not like the cold. I've had way better success with rechargeable.",1.0
I bought this tablet on black Friday and went home to test it out and it was very slow and not worth the money,1.0
"These are absolute junk. I'm half way through the pack and so far every single battery has leaked.UPDATE:Ok, these batteries are horrible. Every single battery leaked, ruining some of the items they were in. In almost 30 years of buying from Amazon these batteries are the most disappointing thing thing I've ever received.Amazon, in case you are interested the lot number is JK150601",1.0
"Aside from the fact that the saleman told me that the tablet would be able to get all the same apps that an Android tablet would be able to get from the playstore, which was hilariously wrong, this product would never connect to the internet correctly. I had to reset the internet every single time on the table for my son to use it, starting from day one and up. My son loved having the electric device and I didn't take it back for those reasons, but now 60 days out, the thing doesn't even charge anymore and I'm having to take it back in. At least I bought the warrenty, because this is literally a huge waste of money. I'd rather have spent $500 on a different tablet than this garbage.",1.0
SPECIAL OFFERS means there are popup ads when you turn on the Kindle for games and books. I called amazon and they want me to pay $15.99 to turn this off! I am returning this and buying another brand of tablet. I am DONE with amazon they will never get a dime from me!,1.0
"They're not a bad value (because they're cheap), but they drain much faster than you would like. I hate throwing dead batteries away anyway (no recycling options here) and 4 of these drained in a day, running a tiny string of LED Christmas lights.",1.0
"I have never had so many issues with a kindle and I have purchased alot. It's slow. It shuts off whenever it wants, the sd card dosent read half the time. And when it does it seems to be downloading it. And it deleted apps off my other kids kindle or adds when I do ... very very stupid . It has cracked . And I have never dropped it . It isn't made well. I am going to return it and I will probably never buy another kindle . HORRIBLE",1.0
"Device does not stay connected to wifi, always disconnecting. This makes product unusable for alarms and timers. When used to work with harmony, at times, does not turn on all devices. Over priced and overrated. Purchased Google Home, for the past week, it has not lost contact with wifi, and works perfectly with harmony hub. Difficult setup with echo, even with 5-6 times with echo support, they can't figure it out. Wish I could return, not too late.",1.0
These batteries only last 2-3 days in my tv remote,1.0
"This cover is made for the Kindle DX and fits it beautifully. The problem - and it's a big one - is if you accidentlly try to open the cover from the back (which is very easy to do) you can damage the Kindle without even realizing what's happened. My husband did this and cracked the Kindle frame within the first week of owning the device. Fortunately, only the frame was cracked and the Kindle still works. We cannot, however, remove the cover because of the way it hooks into the device, the hook closure must be bent because of the accidental attempt to open the back cover. After the incident, we attempted to clip the back cover to the Kindle, but found this to be cumbersome and the clip would not stay in place. We are just extremely careful now, but the damage was done almost immediately. I hope this design flaw has been fixed.",1.0
Great easy to use great pictures great price. Awesome,1.0
Tablet was ok when it worked. Seemed to always have to reset our Wi-Fi at home for this one item. Everything else worked fine.,1.0
Works great for my 6 year old grandson! he loves it.,1.0
"BAD BATCH NOT LASTING!Have been using these for the Roku Remote, and they are dying after just a few days of use.Have been happy with Amazon battery purchases in the past.Not sure if the quality is overall lower than it once was, or if this was just a bad batch.",1.0
"Everything is locked out to Amazon, no compatibility with the Google Play Store and a lot of games the children play are on the Play Store. This product is bad because it is locked into only Amazon services.",1.0
"Worthless, except as a regular echo and a poor excuse for video chat. I love my echo devices, bathroom, pool, kitchen, other places where I may need hands free, voice activated music and info. My wife bought me the 'newest, hottest' thing. I was skeptical but then thought I would use it to help on a project. Me ""Alexa find videos on f450 drone"" Alexa ""YouTube is not available"". Amazon won't directly sell chrome products, youtube won't play on echo show. Further testing shows the video call is more limited than iPhone or Android apps for video. So the most useful thing now is the same voice functions that my echos and dots perform. Unless I want to make all of my video calls and check the weather from a device I can move no more than 3 feet from an outlet.",1.0
"These are awful. So far I've used them in my toothbrush, and have had to replace them 3 times in 6 months. I've also used them in my smoke detector and had to replace them within that 6 month period as well. Seriously I usually can go a few years without replacing batteries in a smoke detector. Waste of money.",1.0

poor quality,1.0
"The batteries had very short life. Long time fan of Amazon.com, first time buyer of Amazon brand batteries. Replaced batteries in a digital clock. After about 3 months (I bought the batteries in August, and now it's November), the batteries were dead. I have had this clock for years and never had any brand of batteries that lasted so short.",1.0
Put together mobile but it refuses to turn. Kind of pointless. Next time would spend a few more dollars and get something more sturdy and reliable.,1.0

"I'm not sure if it's coincidence it not but two electronics we've put these batteries in have crapped out within a day of replacing the batteries. When I pulled them out of the remote that completely spazzed out, there was moisture on the batteries. I thought that may have been my fault but then it happened again with a Christmas decoration. I'll probably return them...maybe a faulty batch",1.0
"I, as well as other Kindle lovers, have noticed that although we have taken great care with the cover, it has warped and has bubbles and is not durable. Within 3 months, and I only started using the Kindle with the cover in the past 2 weeks, noticed the cover has become warped and bubbled under the leather. No idea what would cause this, I have taken great care not to put it near any source that would have done this damage, not sunlight, heat, moisture or anything. I will be requesting a replacement, but Kindle manufacturers of the cover need to do their homework and come up with a better product, especially for the price we paid.",1.0
"These are by far the WORST batteries I have ever purchased. I have previously purchased bulk batteries from other vendors. When I ran out of the previous batteries I thought would order more. When I saw that these were branded by Amazon I thought I could not lose...WRONG! As an example, when I put these batteries in a thermostat they are dead within a few days. I normally put batteries in this thermostat once a year...not every few days. 2nd Example: I put the batteries in a bluetooth mouse (normally batteries last a few months) and they are dead within a week.I don't know if I have a bad batch or what but they are TERRIBLE. Take this into account before you order.",1.0
we have had nothing but trouble with these batteries. i have installed them in multiple products and they are barely lasting any time at all. we will not be buying these again. maybe amazon can provide us with a new batch as maybe we just got unlucky with ours.,1.0

they do not last at all would love to get my money refunded.,1.0
Nice Amazon Fire tablet But...the camera is not clear enough 2.0 megapixels and Amazon Fire is very slow wedsite and app it takes very forever download I think I have to returned on best buy and buy a good tablet 10.1 Lenovo and Samsung Galaxy...I will gave a Zero Rating Star,1.0
More than 1/2 have been dead out of the box. Most other Amazon Basic products I have gotten have been great. Batteries have been beyond sub par so far.,1.0
Do not leave these batteries sitting on a dresser... or pretty much anywhere you don't want battery acid leaked onto. We took the batteries out of our remote at night and woke up to our brand new 3500 dresser ruined. Awesome.,1.0
I use AA batteries in my double electric breast pump. I usually have to replace Duracell every 3-4 days but these I had to replace every 24 hours or so. Truly did not last long!,1.0
"My Mother in Law owns a home decor store with a lot of battery operated things like clocks, etc. We ordered these for her and she spent hours putting them in things all around the store. Once they were on they only lasted about 30 minutes. She then had to go back and take them all out and go out and buy different batteries. Really disappointing and a huge hassle for her. Have never had batteries last such a short time. We were very unhappy.",1.0
"Given its price, probably makes sense but doesn't last very long even with lower power usage or lesser used devices. I'd spend few dollars more and buy Duracell pack from Costco.",1.0

"Shortest life batteries ever, waste of money",1.0
Arrived and maybe only 1/3 of the batteries actually worked. The ones that did not work have little juice to them or some are just dead.Sucks because when I ordered AA batteries from the Amazon brand a while back they worked amazing and were of great price. These are cheap but when you factor in how many of them you can actually use this was not a cheap buy at all.,1.0
Bought two of these 2015 models to add to my previous model on other sets in the house. Both of the new units freeze after about 10 - 15 minutes stating that my 16 MB connection speed isn't fast enough for watching old documentaries from my Prime account. Cycling the power gets it working until it freezes again. The old model works flawlessly. I'll be returning these.,1.0

"I read a lot of reviews and convinced myself the AmazonBasics AA alkaline batteries were going to be a good buy. Nope. I put a pair in my TV remote, and within a month the TV was telling me to replace the batteries because of low power. I decided to check some new ones right out of the wrapper with my battery tester. 8 brand new batteries tested - all 8 in the red on the battery tester...not totally dead, but just inside the red. Next trip to Home Depot, I picked up the big pack of Energizer AA batteries and did the same test on them. 8 for 8 all in the green on my battery tester.Oh well, not worth crying about 13 worth of weak batteries. I am sure others have had great luck with the same AmazonBasics AA batteries. I just wanted to add my experience so others can make an informed decision. Good luck!",1.0
Sadly these batteries are horrible! I hardly ever have complaints about anything I order but these batteries barely have any power and I've had to change them out many times.,1.0

"We purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kid-friendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. Something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets. If you can buy it on black Friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. So now he has no tablet because I am not sending it out to have someone else's sent back to me..re-furbished. I am very disappointed.",1.0
Don't bother. The AA's I bought got remotes last a third as long as everready batteries.,1.0

"What's happened to batteries Duracell use to be the gold standard, until we had over 10 of them fail by leaking and destroying expensive medical equipment year after year. Costco batteries became our go-to batteries until last year 2015 when they started leaking, even on the shelf. Tried Eveready but price and quality varies as well. I trusted Amazon and love the price, packaging, convenience and no leaks. But they don't last half the time the others have. Some of the top reviews have stated the electrical case very, very well. And yes, we have some high current draw uses. But as my staff and Doctors have said to me: They're just batteries! Get us some decent batteries already! We go through dozens a week so price is going to matter but, paying top dollar still doesn't seem to save equipment or increase the usage time. It seems every manufacture is changing their product for cost and marketing so that you have to be an expert to properly match basic AA batteries to your specific use. Not cool!!",1.0

These batteries are the worst batteries I've ever purchased. I am in disbelief how quickly they died! I put them in 2 very small 4 tall portable night lights for my kids and both night lights became very dim overnight. The batteries had to be replaced after 2 nights for the night lights to even serve the purpose. I've since put these batteries in other things around the house and I am not impressed at all. I'll stick to buying batteries at Costco in the future.,1.0
"I don't recommend buying this. After 1 month of buying this, it won't charge or turn on.",1.0
Put these into a high power flashlight and took my dog out. Within ten minutes the flashlight was so dim that it was worthless. I would never buy these again!,1.0
These don't seem to last very long at all. I used them on my light in chicken coop. I replace once a week and only used it 2 or three times each week. Very dissapointed in this purchase. I usually buy our batteries from Costco.,1.0
Batteries die very quickly. Spend the extra for better batteries.,1.0
This item is useless to play music through voice recognition unless you pay for an amazon prime or Amazon music account. Once that is disconnected she only plays your music through manual control from a blue tooth connection from your phone. Pointless!!! More than half the questions I ask her she doesn't know the answers to. The only thing she's good for so far is the time and weather. That basically the most expensive blue tooth speaker and clock I have ever purchased. I want my money back,1.0

After a lengthy time with online customer service I called customer service. After 20 minuets with speaking to a female Elmer Fud that doesn't speak english well I figured I would just return it. Although it looks Identical to the $120 model, you can not adjust the brightness. That would have been good information before I bought it.",1.0

HAD THE AMAZON FIRE TV BOX FOX 1 WEEK AND IT BROKE,1.0
"I purchased the Amazon Fire TV after owning the Roku 3 for a year and after trying both the older and the newest versions and Apple TV. I am a Prime member so this seemed like a perfect choice. However, the remote is very unresponsive, disconnecting more than it stays connected. The menu layout is very ""ad-centric"" and pushes you towards how Amazon wants you to view their service. When the remote works, the Amazon TV seems sluggish in comparison to the other products I tried. After several hours of fighting with the remote, I decided to return it and get another Roku...possibly the version 4. Good try Amazon, but far from being close to either Roku or Apple TV.",1.0
My first tablet was a Kindle. I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed,1.0
"I was initially happy that my Kindle replacement charging cord arrived so promptly, it seemed to work fine. But after only one use, the outer covering of the cord started cracking falling off in bits. It now is almost completely covered by electrical tape, as the bits fall off w/ each every use. I will end up having to buy a new one after all...",1.0
"Lot's of claims in the description and lots of good reviews here, so I don't know what went wrong, but it appears these batteries really stink.In a TV remote, a pair of these batteries lasted 2 weeks. The name-brand batteries they replaced had lasted several months.In an LED flashlight, a pair of these batteries lasted exactly 2 uses before the light got dim and 3 uses before the batteries were totally dead. I'm talking about, like, less than 10 minutes of cumulative use. The previous batteries had lasted dozens of uses probably at least 3 hours of on-time.I don't know if I got a bad batch (a BIG bad batch of 48), or if I was just tricked into having the wrong expectations. Either way, back to name-brand batteries for me.",1.0
I realized after purchasing that the reason you get so many for such great price is because it takes the entire box to equate to one 12 pack of more expensive batteries. The life on these is terrible! I've used them in everything from remote controls to kid toys and they run out VERY fast. Go ahead and spend the extra money for a better quality battery.,1.0
"I had an old ipad and when it quit I decided to go for the amazon fire tablet--really only used it to play games and for entertainment....i hate it---battery life is very short I pretty much need to keep it plugged in at all times, and it freezes and just shuts out of screens. I can't take it anymore and am now going to buy another ipad---don't waste your money on this!! I am very unimpressed with this product and amazon in general now.",1.0
Does not turn well at all. Will be returning it,1.0
"Great price but they don't hold their charge for long. I find myself swapping out the remote batteries twice a year. At this price, it's not so bad but it's much more frequently that I'm used to.",1.0
I have had this product less than 6 months. It shut down unexpectedly and would not restart. I contacted Amazon and the only help they could give was to hold the power button for 40 seconds and when that did not work I was told to buy a new one. Quality of a product is measured in warranty and support. This product comes with very little warranty.,1.0

I am giving these batteries a 1 star because I couldn't go any lower. I tried 10 batteries in a row and they lasted bout 35 seconds then my light went out. The shelf life must have been ending. I guess the old addage You Get What You Paid For holds true.,1.0

I was searching for rechargeable batteries and these came up. I did think it was a great price for rechargeable batteries so I bought two packs.

"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable.",1.0

I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged.

In the soap-dispenser, they lasted three weeks. I thought the dispenser must be faulty, switched them out. Next set of these batteries lasted a week. In the LED lights, the batteries lasted five hours. Less in the toys and tap lights. At this rate, I'll have used the whole box of 20 batteries in less than 6 months.

"I'll give them two stars for the price, but you really do get what you pay for. These batteries seemed to die a lot faster than the Kirkland ones I got from Costco. Or, maybe it's just some of them that fail too soon. I put several new Amazon AA batteries in a few different devices that get a good amount of use. When a couple of those devices stopped working, I tested the batteries. In both cases, only one battery was actually dead, the other was fine. That seems weird, weird enough that I'll go back to Costco for my next battery purchase.",1.0
I bought the Fire for my 8 year old for school after a suggestion from the sales rep in store. Went to set it up and it required a credit card number be entered.

"Had to replace my sons lenovo android tablet and at the same time renew the warranty. Had a few options of brands to choose for the replacement. Lots of family suggested the Amazon even the best buy staff said it was the better choice not to mention the cheapest of the four brands to pick from. Well set up was a disaster. I wasn't aware that this tablet let's you put up to four names under one Amazon account, until after the initial account member name was completed. So now my 7 yr old has an Amazon account. Also didnt lime that i had to put in credit info for set up. And then had to go into settings to put a parental block on in-app purchases. Too many ad pop ups and thats just while it is turning on. In not happy with this tablet . It automatically backs up photos and stuff to an iCloud. I don't know what that is , how to access it, nor is there an icon on the screen for it. Also lots of unnecessary pages and icons all over the screen that can't be changed. My other sons tablet is in need of replacement and warranty renewal. I will not be replacing his with this product.",1.0
I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started.

I purchased these batteries because of the price and the backing of Amazon. I figured Amazon wouldn't put their name on a poor product. I used 12 of these batteries in an application and all 12 failed within a few days. Other batteries lasted months.

We got this for our son. He is always wanting to play on Mom's tablet so we thought this would be a good choice. His aunt does a lot of tech shopping and bought this same one for his sister so we got the same one.

"I have bought these twice-my first purchase, I received the batteries in the silver packaging, had no issues, long battery life, etc. The second order I received the batteries in the gray packaging as pictured. I bought the second back in April, and last week I discovered that every unused battery that I hadn't used up and thrown out was leaking. I threw out 5 batteries one day, and found 3 more that were in use in remotes that needed to be thrown out as well because they had leaked, and had to throw out a remote as well since it had corroded inside.I'm not going to be buying again.

I never counted, but I took TONS of shots using Duracell alkaline bats. Conservative estimate At least 300 shots for each set of two. Einstein not needed to do the math on that. I just looked and see that they are made in Indonesia, which may or may not matter, since I don't know where Duracells are made. I still have 34 of these lousy things left.

I can honestly say that I don't recommend this product as it will damage the kindle. The hinge that attaches to the kindle will eventually put pressure on the kindle front plastic cover and soon you will see it crack. To avoid this, you have to make sure the kindle doesn't rock back and forth from off the back cover causing the hinge to bend more and crack the front plastic further. This is hard to do if you open and close your kindle many times a day or simply lend it to someone else who doesn't know better. One thing I can honestly say is that I really wanted to like this product. I really wanted it to work. I'm looking for a slip cover now.",1.0

At first I believed it was a bad batch of a four pack batteries, no problem, THEN, a week and a half has passed and I had to change the batteries for my clock FIVE TIMES! I hope this review will convince you (the reader) to never purchase these batteries, I know they are not that expensive and I shouldn't make a big deal out of it, but it is frustrating to see the seller LIE MORE THAN ONCE, took their sweet a** time to deliver it to the buyer (about a month in waiting), and never sent any form of confirmation in purchasing their product. Well that's that, have a good one!",1.0

I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up.

Someone there even told me that if I have a ROKU box I can watch it with that instead. TOTALLY UNEXCEPTIONABLE! Me an my wife are long time Prime members and expected a little more from Amazon.

"Bought these in late Nov. By March 1, most of them were dead in the package.",1.0
I bought this thinking that I needed it but I didnt so it was a waste of money.

"I bought this and the kids version past Christmas. Its lack power and storage to be useful unless you want to just read books. Don't waste money on this product. The kids version is a good ideal but loading the apps, when they work takes forever. When they do work, the kids enjoy them. So I consider it to be a hit and miss. I'll be canceling the subscription as soon as my free year is up. Not wasting money on it.",1.0
"One star because this should've been included when I purchased my Kindles. Bought this second one because I have three paper whites and got tired of playing musical charge chairs. And if Amazon would concentrate on the loyal e-book readers rather than the useless fires and increase memory more than the little bit they did on the latest kindle (I own one) I would be a happy camper. We need the option of adding memory (Amazon invent a chip that only you sell and the only one a kindle can use and I'll purchase). Just give us that option. Fires don't work for just straight up reading (can't read in any kind of light because of the shiny screen). Having to purchase these power adapters separately ticks me off. I don't care about the cloud. I need books downloaded to my devices. We vacation often in our mountain house. Middle of nowhere (which I like). However, no wifi, no Internet access and no cell coverage so cloud is useless. I guess I read too much. Thousands of books. 5,000+ in my library at home before a stroke forced me to Kindle and now thousands more. Include adapters when purchasing devices and increase the storage capacity.",1.0
"I was excited about the prices of these batteries, however you get what you pay for. These batteries are awful. I've used them in toys, remotes, and flashlights. The remote lasted for like a week! I used the flashlight for a few minutes and that's all the use I got out of them. I unsubscribed to this item. No thanks.",1.0
"Very disappointed with these batteries. I was using them in a wall clock. The clock repeatedly did not work after a new battery was put in. I figured the clock was no good, since the batteries were new. Bought a new clock, same thing happened. Decided to test the batteries prior to installation. I found that of the twenty batteries I tested, only 2 tested good. So therefore, my first clock probably wasn't bad in the first place, the batteries are faulty. I still have 12 batteries left to test, but I not hopeful that these will be any better.",2.0

"These are odd. Several times so far I have put them into some device and the circuit does not work so it seems dead. Tested the batteries with a tester and they read 1.6 volts, so they are fully charged. Put in energizers, duracells, that show 1.58 volts and the device works perfectly. Tried one of each brand and got mixed results. Good price but Ray o Vacs are about the same and no problem. I don't know what is wrong but for now, I don't like them.",2.0
"I usually buy the 5.00 24 battery special at Harbor Freight, but they were not on sale when I needed some, so I decided to get theseBoth of the batteries are supposed to be Alkaline, so you would think they would both last about the same length of time NO SOI use these in a Personal Pedi Callused Skin grinder, so they get a good workoutAMAZON's batteries just don't last as long.... and it's a NOTICEABLE differenceI'm going back to Harbor Freight's Alkaline's",2.0

"It is too heavy for its size! I purchased it to replace a larger Nook, and find that it weighs as much.

It is not efficient when downloading (buffering, buffering...) and I am still debating returning it for another tablet.",2.0

I thought it was my internet at first but all my other devices work phenomenally fast. I first noticed this after I started using it but I thought I would give it a shot. I've decided to return this and exchange for another $50 tablet tomorrow. This is because I couldn't even watch a simple youtube video today.Here's what I did like. It's name brand.

These just don't last as long as the name brand product. Found that we replace these twice as often as a Duracell equivalent. Won't be buying them again.,2.0
I bought them to go into a flashlight. They never lasted more that a few hours and got really dim. maybe good for things like remote controls,2.0
batteries last a fraction of the time that most of the other well known battery brands do,2.0

Wasnt really impressed with the operating system. Was hoping it was more of android style. Not so much.,2.0
I originally wanted to buy Duracell brand batteries but I bought these instead (Aug. 2016) as they were cheaper. I just today had to remove a set of these from a remote thermometer and they had leaked even though the date printed on the batteries was Jan. 2025. My savings on these cheaper batteries was far less than the cost of my now damaged thermometer.,2.0
Kindle is good as long as it is plugged into a wall outlet. The battery lasts a mere 15 minutes as a portable unit. Not happy with this. Takes an hour to charge the battery to 100% yet drains in 15 minutes. There`s something mathematically wrong with this equation.,2.0
Concerns about syncing our phones to Echo and difficulty loading music was a deal breaker. Maybe its operator error. Not for us.,2.0
These batteries did not work in all items needing AAA batteries. I won't be ordering them again.,2.0

Sooooo... returned.",2.0
Not what I expected .. This thing pretty much runs according to skills & not just ask a question & it searches the Internet. I find Siri much better because it does search the net.

"I have found that a large percentage of these batteries only last about half as long as Duracell. I had assumed that since Amazon doesn't own a battery factory, that these are simply a major brand that is private labeled. So I assumed they would last just as long. My TV remote came with a Sony battery, it lasted a year. I replaced it with one of these and it only lasted 5 months.",2.0
I am all about Amazon Basics but I have ordered several of these for our baby toys and they don't compare at all to the Duracell ProCell that I normally order.

"Pros:- Amazon Prime works on it.- You can still sideload apps, like Kodi.Cons:- Not a good upgrade over the original Fire TV, is worse in some aspects.- Remote buttons are hard to press (compared to original Fire TV)- Remote loses connection frequently and takes several button presses or removing of the remote batteries to fix- Interface isn't as snappy as the original Fire TV- Same interface as the original Fire TV: There's still no good way to sort your apps or locate the Prime content that you want.- Voice search seems about the same as the original Fire TV. Alexa adds nothing significant. You still can't use it to search in 3rd party apps, like Youtube.- As for video decoding in Kodi, performance isn't much better than the original Fire TV. You will be able to play HEVC content at 1080p with no problem, but 1080p .264 hi10p (software-decoded) does not play well. There's simply not enough power. 4k decoding is hit-and miss. It needs to be specifically coded for this Fire TV (low bitrate, low fps) to work properly.- Overall system performance is bad. When sitting idle, the CPUs spike up to 60% usage and memory is at 60% usage. The OS is not well-optimized.I'm not confident that Amazon can fix these issues in a timely manner and their competitors are releasing their media players soon, so I'll likely return this while I still can.",2.0

Amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e-books. It's also nice to get a six-month subscription to the Washington Post. Their claim to have 16 gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you 5 and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage. Another problem is that you can't flag something as being inappropriate like you can on Samsung Galaxy tablets.,2.0

"I gave one star because they were batteries and did not explode in my face which is a major plus. However, if you need batteries for anything you use on a daily basis outside a tv remote then do not buy.

"Thought we'd have tons of fun with Alexa; found that had to stretch to use it productively. Maybe that's why Amazon puts out a steady stream of ""Here's what's new with Alexa"" emails, a lot of them revolving around buying more stuff from Amazon.",2.0

"Batteries are very good, but packaging is horrendous, which is surprising because usually Amazon does a great job with hassle free packaging, but every four bats are packaged in tough plastic.

I was quite disappointed when I began working through the menus and discovered that my 2 year old Roku 3 was far more intuitive. Roku also allows searches of all of your subscribed services. If I am already paying a subscription fee to Netflix or HBO NOW and I can watch a tv show or movie without additional cost why should I pay Amazon to watch it? I am a fan of Amazon services and a Prime member but I also don't want to throw my money away. Roku is still the best.,2.0
For a device with 4k Technology they don't seem to advertise it much. You can barely see it on the box. Also search feature only works for Amazon. That's a waste of a search feature. Remote disconnects from the box often and your have to take the batteries out of the remote to reset it. I would not recommend until Amazon fixes the bugs.,2.0

"When I got my Kindle Fire, I got a protective cover for it and figured I'd be ok, because I don't travel much at all (am bedridden/disabled from car accidents). After a while, I couldn't get the mini-USB cord to stay in the plug on the Kindle. After describing the problem to Amazon, they sent me a new cord (I got the newer one with an AC plug and had to pay for it). Unfortunately this did not solve the problem, and I had to mail them my Kindle, and they shipped me a new one, configured mostly the way I had everything before I sent it, which was very convenient. Using my new cable (purchased through the Amazon Kindle store), I had no problems, at first.With only very light use, primarily for reading books for short intervals, the problem I had before with the mini USB plug on the Kindle not fitting tightly into its socket. After changing up AC to USB, as well as trying both USBs on my computer, I was unable to get the Kindle to start because it had less than 15 charge on the battery but I had no way to charge it. The only way to resolve the issue would be to go through the procedure described above I read a number of the positive reviews (which are usually posted first), and nothing was mentioned about this problem--there were so many reviews I didn't have the time to go through them all. I'm in the middle of a book, and use the Kindle to play Scrabble with a friend, and we're in the middle of a game...So I haven't decided what to do yet... It's after 5 a.m. Sunday morning so I can't call the Kindle Store for advice.I had been considering upgrading to one of the new Kindle products, but after having this recurring problem, I am leery of spending that kind of money, only to possibly have the same issue.Read more",2.0

"I own a high end system with AppleTV 3 and Chromcast media players for Netflix and the likes. I purchased fire tv for 4K. As with other devices I thought I could configure it and forget it. This is not the case with Fire TV. Remote control requires constant attention. Open the back play with batteries, but battery cover back on. Constantly! HDMI port does not work with HDMI switch. It is the only device that I own that does not play well with my switch. Internet connection is poor. Start receiving video won't load errors after a week. I thought perhaps WiFi connection was bad even though no other device had this issue, so I tried wired connection and got same error. Tried restarting it more than any device should need but this did not help. Device is very hot. It is on constantly. No automatic method of turning off when not being used.On the plus side, the interface is the best I seen on any media player. Beautiful picture and screen saver which can be configured. Alexia rocks but limited to basic commands. Amazon Prime integration is excellent as you might expect. Beautiful looking device. After about 10 days I got fed up and returned it.

I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all",2.0
"If you are looking for an inexpensive tablet just for basic web surfing/shopping/etc., I don't know that you can get a better deal. However, that is about all you can do. We found out the hard way that the Fire (which we bought to replace a misplaced iPad, so maybe we were just spoiled) is pretty limited in terms of the Apps you can download. Forget about any Google based Apps and many of the standard apps that are generally available in the Android or Apple market place. I love Amazon itself and don't have any major issues with the product I got for the price I paid, I just won't be going the cheap route in the future.

"I didn't expect a lot at this price, but I also did not expect both of my tablets to be riddled with dead/stuck pixels right out of the box. I have a third arriving in the mail and am just praying that I am at least good for 1/3. Waiting on its arrival before doing the trip for return/replacement just in case that one needs to go as well. Maybe just bad luck, but definitely worth noting for anyone who may also be inconvenienced by having to do a return.Everything else seems good though when you can look past the display issues, but may be worth waiting until these defective lots have been disbursed and the issues have been corrected.I am sure if you don't have these display issues that the product deserves more than 2 stars, but if you can see things from my perspective it is kind of difficult to recommend this to anyone for the time being. If the display did not have these pixel issues I could see this easily being a 4 Star recommendation. If you do a little research you will see that there are definitely some lot numbers that are more problematic than others, so this is not just a rare incident.

"I've always been a fan of the Kindle, ever since the first one came out over a decade again.I was excited about this Kindle due to the many premium features it showed - the all-metal finish, high-resolution ePaper display, backlighting, extended battery life, etc.I was significantly disappointed to see that Amazon pushes ads through the Kindle when you put it into sleep mode, and throughout the store options. Additionally, I was further frustrated by the fact that I learned there was a cellular version (available direct from Amazon) but not through the store. For such an expensive unit, to have ads with no option to disable them, seems unreasonable and like a rip-off. Additionally, the fact that this only supports wifi (not cellular or WhisperSync) makes it even more of a drawback and something I would not recommend to a friend - stick with the cheaper version.I also found annoying problems trying to get my Apple Airpod earphones to work with this device. Pairing took forever to finish or work (had to try three different times) and if the unit sits for too long, I found that I had to go through the entire pairing process again; they were not automatically connected and synced the moment I had both devices turned on.",2.0

I want to start out by pointing out that I honestly was not expecting much to begin with. I was just hoping for something backlit to read with at night.

I got Amazon Music, and needed only to say, ""Alexa, play (insert artist name, song name, or album name)"" and it would play music. The speaker quality is great. 4 days after Christmas it went into a Christmas Music and hymn default. Whatever artist I requested, it would play the first song, and then default to religious music. I'd switch artists and it'd happen again. I contacted Amazon, and was told not to request artists. I needed to specify albums and songs. I don't have this info memorized. I bought it to say artist names. Someone responding to my poor review on Amazon suggested trying different music services. I dumped Amazon music and started requesting music on Pandora. Alexa misunderstood my granddaughters request, and played Christmas music on Pandora, although we were now well into Jan. I'm no longer having the Christmas music problem, but Alexa is just ok playing music from Pandora. Sometimes it gets it right, sometimes not. I am so disappointed in it, that I plug it in when I want to hear music, and unplug it, and ignore it most of the time. When it worked the first two weeks, I raved about it. After witnessing my problems, people who come over don't want one.",2.0

"I really liked the idea of having a device I could talk to out of nowhere that would answer (although our cells phones can do similarly, but you have to turn them on and press buttons, etc.).

Jeff needs to pay to send his programmers back to search school. So many times Alexa says a phrase similar to I don't understand the questionSo basically I paid for a radio.

Popped in some Amazon batteries, 1 month and the second child didn't play with it nearly as much as the first. For the price it was worth the try but I'm going back to the other brands.",2.0
These batteries do not last long at all as compared to Energizer. After 4 days of use they were no good anymore. The Energizer batteries have last me two weeks so far when using for the same thing. I will be using far more batteries so it really isn't a money saver. Disappointed!,2.0

"These batteries did their job but did not last very long at all. At the time of writing this I used them about two months. Normally that would be good, but I only was using them in a set of LED string lights that I kept on at most an hour a day.

Amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e-books. It's also nice to get a six-month subscription to the Washington Post. Their claim to have 16 gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you 5 and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage.  Another problem is that you can't flag something as being inappropriate like you can on Samsung Galaxy tablets.,2.0
"It's somewhat of a step up from the Roku 3 I was previously using, but not as much as I was expecting. I think it's a couple firmware updates away from being better than it is now.Spent the good part of the day trying to figure out why I could only connect to my dual-band router at 2.4GHz and not 5GHz. 1.5 hours on the phone with Verizon FiOS tech support was unsuccessful as other devices connected at 5GHz without issue. Was about to pack it up and return it until I called Amazon tech support. Turns out it's a known-issue that the FireTV has difficulty with 5GHz networks that are set to auto channel selection and are utilizing channel numbers above 100.The tech support person said I should change the channel to 36, 44, or 48 instead of automatic, and, it worked.Bluetooth audio and video are out of sync with Showtime, Netflix, Sling, Plex and Hulu. It's fine through speakers, but video lags slightly behind the audio using Bluetooth. Audio and video are in perfect sync with Bluetooth and Amazon Prime Video which makes me think it'll be fixed at some point, as Amazon provided video demonstrates it can work well in that regard.Gotta say I prefer the platform agnostic UI of Roku, with Amazon-world tucked away in an app. The FireTV navigation pane represents mostly Amazon products with no option to modify it. Roku's UI is more about the media, less about the provider. Voice search works well if you want only to be presented with Amazon's viewing options, for some reason I thought search was universal, but only movies and TV shows available through Amazon show up. Bummer :-(The FireTV-2 is OK, less than I was expecting and with other good options around the corner, I'm beginning to doubt my choice...",2.0

"It is tough to use these tablets if you are use to Apple products. Internal memory is minimal and is taken up by all of the Amazon programs it is running.

The fire tv does not display in 4k.. it processes in 4k but cant display 4k.. This is because of the dumb design..

"So, I purchased a pack of these a month ago (11-Dec-2015) and was using them as expected, when I hit a snag. At LEAST 3 batteries from this pack were marginal/undervoltage (1.5V) out of the box. I found this out because I had replaced a pair of batteries in one of my remote sensors for my wall mounted indoor weather station because the had sensor stopped working. I thought maybe I had inserted them wrong, but no, the +/- marks matched the batteries. So I tried several times to reset both the sensor and the station with no luck. At one point, I had all of the batteries out to force a reset and put them back. But now my weather station would not power up either.That was the clue I needed. I got my trusty multimeter (with battery tester) and checked out all 5 of the Amazon Basics AA cells. Like all NEW 1.5V batteries, most of them showed 1.6V which is typical. Two of them were at 1.48V, which was just low enough for them to be considered undervoltage. No new AA battery should arrive with 1.5V. This is the first and only time I have ever seen fresh batteries arrive in a not as new condition with caused problems with my electronics.I generally like all of the various Amazon Basics products (mice, HDMI cables, etc.), but this has caused me to have doubts about not only their AA batteries, but all of the house branded products. Buyer beware (Caveat Emptor) seems to be the bottom line.",2.0

We are very disappointed in the quality of Amazon's AA batteries. They have failed 3 or 4 times in various products we own. The most costlywas it's use in our small wall safe in our home. The 6 batteries failed after two months and we had to have a service open it at the tune of225.00. Another example was a radio and flashlights. We will have to throw the rest out.,2.0
"Maybe I had higher expectationin general i will not recommend since the service of Amazon solving situations is not as good as in other products, I've had so much troubles with the amazon free time, I am even not longer using it (it was one of the ""big"" features on the advertisment.

"I received this as a Christmas gift. I was excited about this new product and downloaded the Alexa App. I am not an Amazon Prime member and I did not joined the free trial. I asked questions to my Alexa and it usually did not provide any answers, or couldn't understand my questions despite giving simple commands. The device looks good and the LED light on top that turns on when you speak to it is great. Sound is good for music. However, I did not feel that it was a good assistant. I did not like that you have to download skills to make Alexa have more function. You always had to speak Alexa, and then ask the skill you downloaded. It then gets to a point that you don't even remember what skills you downloaded so you always had to look at your phone or mobile device to see what you had. I exchanged it for the Google Home and it has been a better device. It plays music from Google Music and not only music that you have purchased. It answer a lot of questions and gives you great news briefing instead of downloading the particular skills. It also provides more answers to questions and I was surprise by the detail of the answer at time. I highly recommend to Google Home device. I have not tested it with chromecast, Smart TV, or with Smart home appliances such as Nest, etc.",2.0

They still didn't work in any of the flashlights but did work in a remote control and a toy. (I tried a different brand of batteries in the flashlights and they worked fine.)

Not to mention, I have 2 controllers (one has a grip), so I switch between them often. This means they should last longer since I'm not just draining the battery life on one of them. Overall, not great for gaming or heavy use, otherwise they're nice backups. I'll have to compare these to say Duracell, but from past experience I don't remember having to change them so often.",2.0

"I purchased my Kindle2 in March of 09 - and it came with this adapter and cord. It is now October 09, and the small part of the adapter for this cord has stopped working. Fortunately, I was able to plug the CORD part into my laptop's USB port, and charge the Kindle that way. While plugged into a wall socket using Amazon's adapter, it does not charge at all (no light, no charge, no nothin'). I tried using the USB/Power adapter for my iPod, but the charge light blinked intermittently, and it seemed to drain the Kindle's battery. I have only had this for 9 months. I think the adapter should last longer than that. Preferably, Amazon could/should have come up with an interface that allows the use of adapters we already have - like for our phones or iPods. It's not rocket science... but it IS marketing. I came online to purchase the replacement, but I'm not sure I want to buy the same thing....

"Not worth buying, these are just a slight grade above cheap Chinese batteries. Your going to replace them x2 or x3 times as often as top of the line batteries.

"The tablet was bought for a few family members, two of which have bought several Kindle books. But only the price is the only note worthy thing about it. If you buy it for 50 bucks, you have pay another 15 to remove the ads and since this is from Amazon, there is no Google Play to get more app selection.True, you can try to side load the Google Apps but the average tablet buyer won't do this. Also, the battery life is poor compared to tablets like the iPad Mini or other decent Android slates. I'd recommend a Samsung tablet or an iPad before I would recommend this, unless you have a very specific use for it and did not want to spend a lot of money.",2.0
"Might be okay. But, they seem cheap. They have warm light (orangeish in color). They have the feeling that they might only last a year or too, and not multiple Christmas seasons.

They will ultimately work, but are going to be stretched to do so. Picture is of the loan gunmen candle (screw the built of n timer!!!).",2.0
"I got this tablet with high expectations given it's from Amazon. However it was disappointing in many ways and it will be returned.First off, despite of the small screen size, it's heavy. Too heavy to be used as a book reader in bed.The deal breaker for me was that there's no way to connect a VPN using the regular Android settings. The option has been deactivated and accordingly to the tech support, ""it's not available yet, but it will come"". Surprisingly, still according to them, none of the new Amazon tables on sale have such support! Apparently Amazon doesn't believe that open WIFI at coffee shops, supermarkets, airports offer data security risks for the tablet users.On top of that, the Amazon version of ""Google Play Store"" has a reduced number of Apps and the ones I was interested in are not available.And the cherry on the top, was that only after 15 min of small usage (I was still trying to find a way to connect to my VPN), the screen frozen and the tablet became unresponsive.Too bad! I really wanted to like it.",2.0

I bought this thing refurbished. I find that I have to unplug / plug back in the HDMI cable on a regular basis when switching inputs on the TV. Not sure if it is the Amazon Fire box itself or if it is the TV (Not likely).Otherwise it is a good device. I bought it for the ability to hard wire my Ethernet connection to my gigabit switch and for 4K capabilities which it does do. Having the Alexa app is handy but her features can be severely handicapped.I probably should have just bought it new..... usually refurbished devices work well as they are tested before resale and it was probably tough to catch that the HDMI port on these might be finicky. I may have to switch it out.,2.0

"Amazon seems to have changed the manufacturer of this battery. I liked it very much the last year, but the new one has a different look, has noticeably lower capacity, and leaks. Batteries usually leak after they die, but these leaked while they were still good... and apparently died because of the leak. All of my devices have battery monitored One day they were good with 50-90 power left, and they died suddenly the next day. The leaks were mostly minor but clearly noticeable from body discoloration.One thing that has not changed from before is the packaging, and it is still bad. They are shrink-wrapped 4 in a package and they are hard to open as there is no cut-out or pull-tab to break the wrap. It is difficult to break open by hand. Twisting the package causes undue stress to the batteries and that may be cause of the leak. I have had to use scissors or knife to cut open the package.",2.0

"I am extremely disappointed with these batteries, which stems not from longevity or power, but with fit. Almost immediately upon receiving them I installed them into three electric candles. No joy. I cleaned the contacts, still no joy. I tested the batteries, full charge. Just for grins, I installed into one candle three Ray-O-Vac brand batteries, and the candle lit with no problem. Removed the Ray-O-Vacs, installed the Amazons, and again, no joy. I repeated this a couple of times with the same results. And I tried this in the other two candles with identical results: All three candles lit with the Ray-O-Vacs, none with the Amazons. Knowing the issue was not with candles, I took a Ray-O-Vac and lined it up with an Amazon, and discovered something interesting: the batteries were just a wee bit different.The length of the positive terminals are different, just a tad longer on the Ray-O-Vac (see picture). The Ray-O-Vac terminal is taller (longer) while the Amazon terminal is squat-tier and therefore shorter. The difference in length is tiny, no question: but when you're putting batteries into a rather cheap device to start with, that tiny bit of length in this case seems to be the difference between one battery forming a sufficient connection and the other one not. I'll keep the Amazons to use in devices (mice, for example) that are likely more solidly built than these candles and have a greater connection tolerance (or a stronger spring) to hold the battery firmly in place. I am concluding that when replacing batteries in an older device (that may not force as firm a connection) or in a cheapo device that may not hold batteries tightly from the get-go, use a branded-name battery.I am a longtime and extremely satisfied user of Amazon Basic computer cables (among their first products in the Basics line), but was recently disappointed with another item I purchased outside of the computer connectors and cables line (that being dog house-training piddle pads, which have not proven as absorbent as similarly-priced products, and I've bought a lot of different brands). The batteries were my second foray into Basics product lines outside of the oh-so-dependable-cables arena, and now I'm 2 for 2 in the disappointed column. I never thought there was a difference in batteries, and now I know differently. The next time I see a Duracell commercial emphasizing reliability and dependability, I'll think back to this experience, as I will when selecting batteries in the future. I so wanted to like these Amazon batteries, too.",2.0

"A wonderfully designed device, but its use is fairly limited. I bought it primarily to use as a Smart Home control device. However, although it allows you to turn on and off lights, you cannot add timers to the control instructions. For instance, you cannot tell the Echo to turn off a light in 30 minutes; you can only tell it to turn it off or on immediately. Finding that out was incredible disappointing. I don't know understand why it would be so hard to add such a feature.",2.0

This really isn't a very good tablet by any measure other than bang for your buck.

I only used it to read some comics and play games on a screen bigger than a phone so I got what I wanted out of it.,2.0
"I bought 2 Amazon Kid's Fire Tablets for my two grandsons for Christmas. Included in the purchase of the A.K.F. Tablets is a one year subscription to KID's Free Time.I have called & emailed inquiring about the registration process in order for my daughter to activate & begin using the free one year subscription of KID's FREE TIME, & still no resolution.Upon trying to register tablets, credit card used to purchase is required. I do not understand why my credit card needs to be submitted in order to obtain/activate a service that is included in the already PREPAID Purchase!I have been waiting for a response since Christmas.Therefore, at this time, I would have to give a 2 star rating due to the lack of customer service available for this product. With hope of getting this issue resolved I would still recommend to a friend.",2.0
They didn't last as long as say Duracell..in my opinion.,2.0
It's just ok. Will work but not what I wantedTo controlled by Amazon,2.0
"These batteries are HYPED! Duracell always wins. I bought them for electronic circuit for my experiments and I can clearly see how they fail against Duracell AAA batteries. I also wonder about the review someone has put that shows the performance plots. Under standard conditions doesn't matter, batteries need to perform the way consumers use them. To be fair, these batteries are better but don't show them as the best in the world, no way!",2.0
"I purchased this device to stream movies to a room that had minimal apps. The I tried to activate Netflix, I kept getting an error on log-in.

Only 3 worked out of the entire pack.,2.0
"These batteries seemed to die very quickly. We used them for xbox one and wii controllers and while I wasn't the only person to use them, nor was I always around when they were being used to gauge the amount of their use, I seemed to have to replace batteries weekly.",2.0

Price is nice but performance was not. Sluggish to the point of frustration even to my 4 year old. Would be fine as ereader or maybe basic web device.,2.0

Very poor quality. Lasted on one week in motion sensor that is used infrequently.,2.0
"I've kept a stock of these batteries for about a year (in a drawer in my living room) and used them in my air freshener with no problems. However, when I used them with my Pawbo toy (it's a remote cat toy), not only do they not last very long, but I just went to replace the batteries and saw that were leaking after only a day!",2.0
"Not a high performance battery, it's good for timer lights but not for regular usage, will not order these again...",2.0
Strings are not as long as described.,2.0
I have no issue with the actual batteries. They work fine. My problem is with the extremely wasteful packaging. The 20-pack comes in an oversized cardboard box with two slots for 10 batteries each. They could just as easily package them in a small thin cardboard box.,2.0
Cheap tablet but solid built. Weak audio and poor camera.,2.0
"I thought I was getting a great deal, but I learned the hard way if you don' use them up quickly, they go dead in a hurry. Extremely limited shelf life so don't buy these in bulk if you don't plan to use them w/ in 6 mo.s. If your using them in medical equipment, I'm sorry to say I'm choosing another battery. I don't like bashing an Amazon product and there's always the chance I got a bad batch but in this instance, (medical equipment) you want power when you need, I had several groans from the bfrnd about his TV remotes eating up his batteries, I thought my wireless mice were eating them up as well, so I bought another mouse, but when I put 2 fresh packs in my ten's unit 4 ea. time they started out weak then didn't last 15 min ea.. set it's time to choose another brand of battery not the product your putting it in. I did test the one's I took out before putting the new one's in. I didn't think to test them before putting them in.....",2.0
"The processor is very slow. The tablet is great for reading books and ordering stuff from Amazon, but it is really slow opening aps. Pay more to get the better processor.",2.0
Not happy with quality. Do not last very long in various devices.My guess is that milliamp hour ratings are very poor/low.I have used many of these batteries in a short time span compared to Duracells.,2.0

They lasted really little.. (some of them) I use all batteries for same led lamps and 2 out of 4 Drained the Battery Quickly.,2.0
"The one purchased at Best Buy had black and gray lines appearing across the screen when powering up. It got worse, to occurring while using it.

The charging plugs on these kindle damage way to easy. I am very disappointed as this is not the first time this has happened to one of my kindles.,2.0
This pillow is made of memory foam but it is rock hard. It actually made my neck pain worse. The reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is that the fabric feels nice and seems well made. This may work for some people but not me.,2.0
I purchased this for my mother in law. She is getting old and wanted something she could see.The font size was never quite right for her and she was often confused by all the attempts this device makes to sell you something. It really wasn't a good fit for her.The device died approximately 1 week after purchase. We returned it for a refund.,2.0
"We use battery operated candles with timers. The batteries normally have to be changed once a month. These cheap batteries lasted 2 weeks. I thought these batteries were a good deal, but I was wrong.",2.0
TERRIBLE! Barely lasted three hours during a digital camera shoot where Duracell lasts multiple days.,2.0
"In my personal opinion, this product would be unable to satisify any adult, whether it was for business or pleasure. Limited apps, limited space, slow uploading, etc. Also, due to this being an amazon product, many apps and options are unavailable, that are commonly used with both android and apple products. So I would not recommend to anyone.",2.0

"It all depends on what your using a 50 dollar tablet to do is it for extreme gaming then i highly do not recommend this device. It is better for light use on the safe side use for 5h a day. 8h a day battery is the average, but runs down faster and over heats when playing a 3D game. But if u are on tight budget it is useful. ANOTHER MAJOR PROBLEM is that almost all apps that you would get on iphone and android are not availabe on the amazon fire appstore and there is no way to download them, for example clash of clans, racing rivals( which have decided to withdraw from the amazon contract and delte there game off amazons app stores). And other bigger titles omg even snapchat is not on there.",2.0
"I have to say it was a little confusing and frustrating when i was not getting the verification code from amazon , i waited for 20 minutes then i requested another code, nothing... then a nother one... and still nothing , i started to set up the device at 8.30 am and by 11.20 am i was fed up with it.. i had to step away.... after about 5 hours we went shopping and at the mall i recieved about 4 codes from amazon ....",2.0
"Would not buy these again. I reluctantly gave it a 2nd star because the price was good, but the batteries are pretty much 1 star. These get pretty good reviews so I was excited about them. Then the kids kept coming back WAY TOO FAST asking for batteries for their Wii remote. It didn't make sense to me until I tossed some in my blood pressure monitor. That thing runs for many months or years on a set of batteries, but not these! Only weeks with these. I don't have any kind of meter or anything like that to check them, but the proof is in the usage.......it's awful. Buy something else with a brand name.",2.0
The battery is having more and more trouble holding a charge. I bought the Fire in July and am now having to charge it every day in order to use it. I am not impressed and would not repurchase it.,2.0
These die a lot quicker than typical energizer and duracell batteries,2.0
"About half of the batteries won't recharge, so I threw them away",2.0
This tablet could be so much better if the apps actually worked decently. The built in Amazon pieces for Prime members is great and work flawlessly. But it's not enough to overcome the terrible app behavior and countless freezes.  They need to take a lesson or two from Apple.,2.0
I'm not particularly happy four of them have already had to be replaced they don't last very long,2.0
"This charger FRIED my Kindle Fire, Samsung Galaxy S6, and Samsung Galaxy J7. DO NOT plug your other devices up to it!!! It easily comes detached from the Fire tablet but does charge it. I'm just very unhappy that it killed my other devices. There are young children in my home and they know the difference between Apple and Android charging tips. So they will use any available charging cable they find when needed.",2.0

"I wanted to like this a lot because my Ipad Mini is ""heavy"" to carry in my purse all the time. This is so very light.

I had to go through being on hold FOREVER to get someone to help get this off my device so that was an IMMEDIATE turn-off. I don't find it to page-turn handle as well as my OLD ORIGINAL NOOK OR NOOK COLOR and certainly not anything like the Ipad Mini. If I hadnt kept it too long to return I would have. It doesn't auto correct to landscape then portrate, nope you have to MANUALLY CHOOSE ONE OR THE OTHER AND GOING BACK AND FORTH IS just stupid...it should have been part of the IMPROVED design, THEY REALLY MISSED THE MARK FOR THE PRICE. i CAN GET A FULL TABLET FOR LESS MONEY THAT DOES ALL THAT AND SIMPLY USE THE KINDLE APPPROSLight weightSmall for purseback lightCONS1-comes preloaded with ads2-not easy to get them off if you buy device in a store3-page control is not that simple4-t doesn't auto turn from landscape to portrate you have to set it to one OR the other5-not as touch responsive to anything6-don't like the organization of it",2.0

"I compared these against the Costco Kirkland brand and was quite disappointed with the Amazon Basic AA batteries. I used these in a flashlight test and after two hours, the Costco brand still worked fine, but the Amazon Basics were close to dead. I'm very disappointed with this brand and won't buy it again. For short term use, it's fine, but they don't last over time.",2.0

not long lasting move on pay more get more,2.0
I thought from the reviews that I had found a really good battery for less money than I usually paid for DuraCell but I was wrong. I put these in a my battery operated Halloween decorations and they lasted exactly 3 weeks on a 4 hour timer mode. The pumpkins where I used DuraCell are still glowing brightly. Guess it's back to the other brand for my battery operated Christmas decorations.,2.0
These batteries don't last very long at all. Save your money. I don't recommend,2.0
"The only problem that I had is that it should have been included with the Kindle Paperwhite. There is no way to charge the Paperwhite unless you buy the charger.

"First, bought it 15 days before it went on sale everywhere. Next, store doesn't tell you about all the ads offers that come with it and you must pay $15 to disable them. Performance is slow; keypad is slow, am typing faster than it can register resulting in lots of typos. Watching movies is decent, but sound could be better. It drops WiFi more than I'm used to. Have several apps that cannot be installed on it and a few that consistently crash. Good battery kifre, but Quite slow to recharge. Sometimes the ""keys"" stick and can't get out of something even with home key, must restart. Thought this would be cheap temporary solution but this is better served by my 5 year old grandson.I got $50 worth of tablet.Compared to the look and feel of my old iPad, its like I'm still using a VCR and everyone else is on blue ray.",2.0
"I accidentally cracked my screen on the first day when the Voyage was too close to my rocking chair and neither Best Buy nor Amazon would do anything to help. Well, Amazon offered $15 off purchasing the Paperwhite and that wasn't something I wanted at all. Now I'm stuck with a $199 broken Voyage. Not a happy customer. I realize it was my fault but thought they should do something more to minimize the loss and keep my business.",2.0

"We had two AppleTVs - one in the master bedroom and one in the living room. We could not watch both simultaneously because the signal permeated the shared wall and changed the channel of the other TV. We got the AmazonTV to remedy this.

I got this to replace the iPad for a child. I am so disappointed by the charge. It dies so quickly and the charger has to be wrapped around the tablet in order for it to charge. This was after 2 weeks of having the tablet. Low price but not worth the hassle and disappointment!,2.0

I leave it plugged in but it needs to be unplugged every few weeks, otherwise it works fairly well. The Fire TV had to be unplugged after every use. The screen would flash and sometimes there would be a popping sound. If I left it plugged in for any amount of time, then it would not work well. I liked the voice search on it and Alexa works great. You can ask for the weather, play music, and presumably other things that the Echo, Dot, and Tap can do. Just a side note, you have to keep the button pressed when asking Alexa to do something.Maybe I had a defective unit, maybe it was something else. But I've had a Paperwhite and a Voyage that both died on me in similar ways. I've never had a problem with the lower end Kindles or Fire tablets.

I'm still going to use Amazon for a variety of things, but I no longer trust them for the higher end products that they make and sell.",2.0
"I don't want to get too negative on this, because it does what it's supposed to. However, I'm not sure how Amazon justifies charging 40! Half that and I'd feel a lot less disappointed. It's nothing like the last generation cover, which was hefty and substantial. That thing could take a beating! This one Umm...not so much.PROS:- I really like the solution Amazon came up with to lock the Kindle in place sort of a rubberized cup that grips it on all four sides and holds it VERY securely. No more metal-prong slide-release gizmo.- It looks quite nice and is genuine (if untextured) leather like the last one.CONS:- Flimsy. The leather is extremely thin and unpadded. Won't stand up to much abuse. scrape it even lightly on a rough surface and you'll likely ruin it.- The actual cover that folds over the front is incredibly floppy and delicate -- it's about the thickness of a piece of notepad cardboard. I could bend it in half with almost no effort, if I had the notion.- Cover has no lock/closure mechanism (like the elastic strap on the last gen model). It should have SOMETHING.Oh, well. It is what it is. I never read with the Kindle in the case anyway so it's not such a big deal to me, but I was expecting more. Especially for this price!",2.0

"Maybe I got a bad batch. However, with 48 batteries, you'd think if that were the case that some of them would work well, and for me they have not. The main way these are being used are in an Xbox remote. The Xbox is only used to run Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video on our tv, so I am basically using the game remote as a TV remote. It is never used for playing video games. That being said, I am lucky if a set of 2 of these batteries lasts 10 days in this remote. That is a far cry from name brand batteries I have bought. I purchased these thinking they would be a great deal. However, going through them 3x as fast as other batteries makes them a worse value, not to mention it is annoying to have to change them out so often.

Beware, there is a much more limited selection of apps available for this device. Browsing is slow, even while in the same room with my modem. Much slower than my phone or my other tablet. Tumblr app, though able to be downloaded, malfunctions consistently. Will probably return this and get a more capable tablet, but will give it another couple of days to get used to it before doing so.",2.0
"I have always gone to buy a kindle because I like the books and th games available. But I found them very unpredictable and unreliable. The color burns futon screen, then the screens starts jumping.

"These are nicely packaged and initially I was impressed - I didn't have to go to the store to buy batteries, they were cheaper than alternatives, and the packaging was great. I opened the first set of 4 AAA batteries and sadly found out one was already dead. We also ordered AmazonBasics AA batteries and had the same problem. 1/4 were dead. I hope this isn't a pattern for the rest of the box.",2.0

"I have used these batteries in several items from flashlights to toys. I have found them less than adaquate for the items they were used in. In my flashlights, I have found they last with average use about 3 weeks. Not very good. For controllers like TV remotes, they last less than a month. They may be cheper in the short run but they become much more expensive in the long run. I will not buy them again and suggest paying a bit more and getting the name brand batteries.",2.0

"Just opened a brand new box of Amazon AAA batteries 100 count . Sorry Amazon, but I had to open several packages of 4 only to discover. That most of the brand new batteries contained in the box arrived DEAD. I put a meter on the batteries to check for voltage. Some read 1v DC some read 0v dc and some read 2. volts. The batteries I removed from my head set were weak but at least had 1 volt As you can see in the photo the freshness date states 12-2026. . I certainly expect to find more dead batteries in that box. I don't have the time to check each package of 4 right now. Not good Amazon. I am concerned, because I purchase your packages of 9 volts and packages of AA as well. will I be surprised and disappointed as well",2.0

"I purchased a box of these. First replacement for my outdoor weather info transmitter didn't work so well. Within a couple of days the receiver wasn't receiving a signal from the transmitter, so I changed out the batteries once again. Within 96hrs the receiver once again showed low battery power coming from the transmitter and wouldn't display a temperature reading. This week I'll replace those again (3rd time in 6wks) and expect a low-battery warning just days after. Unsure if I should demand an exchange or full reimbursement. Maybe they do well in warm temps, but in the cold temps they cannot perform like a Duracell or Energizer.",2.0
Unfortunately I've been using a far superior tablet when I decided to purchase the Amazon Fire tablet. Comparisons are unavoidable. The Amazon Fire works. Amazon only apps are not as numerous as Google. The tablet is not as streamlined as my other tablet.,2.0
It's silly these aren't provided with the purchase of a Kindle. Super expensive.,2.0
the tablet is certainly a good value but the wifi signal drops frequently and even when it shows its connected can fail to download any data. Perhaps this is a glitch that will be fixed in a later SW update but for now I have to say the performance is underwhelming. the Backlight also has some serious bleed issues which is a sign of an inferior design and or workmanship. The fire 7 HD which i also own has none of these issues. Get what you pay for rings true again.,2.0

"The longevity of these batteries is nothing special. They do not compare to Duracell or Energizer alkalines. After reading the reviews, I was greatly disappointed.

"Like DOS, you need to memorize your command and speak it out, otherwise it may not understand your command. Google Assistant is smarter. Also you cant use Spotify free account, to work around you must add a lot of free music to Amazon music into your own amazon music account before you can hear any music. Google home is more convenient this case, as you can start listening to any music channel by your free account from Spotify. If you have paid account for Spotify then not much different here. But to do searching you may be disappointed with this Tap, Google Home is just much smarter. The sound of this Tap is very good indeed, but I return it because it cant do music alarm, also it cant use Spotify for free, also its search is not smart enough, so I switched to Google Home.",2.0

"I bought this tablet as a replacement for my wife's Fire TV HDX 8.9 as her battery life is starting to decrease as it is getting older. Unfortunately, she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise (the next step is 10"" which is way too big, and has 4 less hours of battery life) and I was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode HEVC, like the Fire TV 2015 boxes we have connected to our televisions. This unfortunately is a show stopper, as we can't view the movie library we have on this tablet. We will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved.",2.0
"This version of kindle was not very impressive to me. Navigating was easier on my older kindle, this model is smaller. Also I have had an issue with charging on this device since I purchased it. When it does accept the charge it will charge to 100% rather quickly, however the battery life dies out so much faster as well. At times when I am using I will try to keep the charger connected due to this problem however it is constantly making a ""ding"" noise off and on as the charger connection does not fit well & keeps falling out. I even purchased another charger to see if this would alleviate the issue, it did not.",2.0
1st kindle screen failed & had to reboot often. Customer Service couldn't fix. Replaced. 2nd one screen reboots often. Customer service offered replace. Just want one that works. Can't get upgrade replacement,2.0
I have to admit I was not too happy with these and probably won't buy them again. The 'life' on them is extremely short and definitely leave a lot to be desired.,2.0
The Video quality on this is lacking compared to other streaming devices. In the plus side you can use kodi. I would get a roku if you don't plan on using kodI or a nividi shield if you plan on using kodi.,2.0
"We bought WowWee MiP robots for our grandsons, 8 and 11 years old. They don't have iPad or iPhone in their home. So thoroughly researched what else would work for installing the app. Talked with Best Buy salesperson, who said the app could be loaded via the app store (it can't).Kindle Fire 2015 is included on the WowWee ""compatibility"" list. So we bought them each a brand new Kindle in order to use the app. They had Kindles from earlier years, but these wouldn't support the Bluetooth functionality needed for the robots.ABSOLUTE FAIL. We tried EVERY possible configuration (adult vs child Amazon accounts; Bluetooth on first or off first; MiP on first or off first; etc). It never worked at all ~ not even once.Also tried full factory reset on each device, loading the app via a Google Play account, rather than Amazon Kindle account. Google Play wouldn't load the app; said it wasn't compatible with this Kindle device.Opened a ticket on WowWee. The response was that they've had the same experience - the bluetooth on this Kindle fails and so the app doesn't work with the WowWee robots. They admit it fails, yet it's still on their approved list.So this was an absolute waste of money, tho at least the boys can play some free games we loaded for them.",2.0

I've owned multiple, but I have never had this problem before with an ePad tablet when I just bought it. I will now have to visit Best Buy again tomorrow for an exchange. I'm hoping they're still in stock. It's not Best Buy's fault. The fault lies with Amazon. They're clearly not that durable.",2.0

Other than that, this scale would have been fantastic. One thing to note, the weighing platform is not silver itself, but rather appears to be a silver plastic.",2.0

Because we can't afford to go through batteries so quickly, I change them once a week. It's really sad that they don't hold up longer.

"A day or two after these batteries arrived, I installed several of them in toys and our small keyboard (which also has A/C power). The next morning, my son called me into the living room, Mom! There's chocolate sauce all over the 'piano' and the table. It wasn't chocolate sauce. It was battery acid. As he said, good thing I didn't taste it!For what it's worth, the keyboard was plugged in, and it had not been turned on or played since the batteries were installed. The five new batteries were in place for about 18 hours before the leak was discovered.The green seal fell off of two of the five batteries as I removed them from the compartment. The acid left a 2 stain on my table.The other batteries that I installed that day still seem to be okay, although I've developed a paranoia about checking them! I have used Amazon batteries in the past with no problems, which is why I'm giving 2 stars, instead of 1. The attached photo shows the rings that fell off. (I wish I'd taken a photo of the puddle they left on the keyboard and table, but I was too focused on clean-up to stop and take a picture.)You'll also note that these batteries are darker in color than the product image that is currently shown. They came this way, and I'll use that difference to keep an eye on their performance/durability.",2.0

My daughter has also gone through 2 batteries in her mouse as well (though she spends most of her time on her laptop with the touchpad).The shipping was fast and you get several batteries for a low cost, but I think a more economical way to go is to spend a little extra on name brand dependable batteries that last 2-3 times as long.",2.0
"My initial impression of this was very good. The material is nicer than the shiny stuff on my Hama CD binders and the netting trim gives a nice appearance compared to plain look of most budget CD binders.There are 50 pages with 8 disc pockets each (4 per side) giving a total of 400 capacity. The pages are hung from the spine in two groups of 25. By that I mean that 25 pages all have a single attachment point to the plastic spine.This is where the first problem with this binder lies. Because each group of 25 pages shares the same anchor point in the spine, the pages cannot sit flat once full of discs. They bend and arch, and apart from looking tatty this puts a lot of tension across the plastic film. With long-term usage I suspect this plastic film will will tear due to the tension. It also makes it awkward to browse the binder as the pages don't sit flat. It may even crack or bend your discs.I look to my Hama 120 binder to see how it *should* be done - it only has 30 pages and yet they were smart enough to hang them from the spine in 3 bundles of 10. This spreads out the pages and allows easy browsing of the binder without putting any of the pockets under tension.After just 2 weeks in storage I opened the binder and the corners of all the pages have become dog-eared by themselves. This is due to the poor design and poor fit of the binder pages when filled with discs. Again, it is not a problem I have seen with my other disc binders, my two-year-old Hama binders look as good as new.Overally this binder has a lot of storage at a good price. If that's all you want you will probably be happy with the product. But sloppy design prevents it from being anything more than a mediocre binder. I feel that whoever designed this did not bother to fill it with discs to see how it would cope.",2.0
Decent product. Not so much if you're used to android software. You can't get your photos saved in google. More than half of my music collection vanished once the memory card was inserted.

This was a replacement for my son who's original kindle broke. He likes it a lot. Just wish we could figure out how to get all the old content we had bought from the old one into the new one.,3.0
"These work pretty well. They don't seem to last quite as long as Duracell or Energizer, but for the price I will continue to buy.",3.0
I actually ended up returning this item because I got frustrated with the adds. If it wasn't for that I probably would have given it 5 stars.,3.0
This is a good tablet for basic use. I ened up returning it and going with an iPad which met my needs more. This tablet would be good for someone with limited computer knowledge/use.,3.0
"I've had every Kindle e-reader available. Though it doesn't have all the features available on the Voyage, the Paperwhite is the best. The issue I've had are the emergence of tiny light ""leaks"" emerging from the source through the matte textured page background. They're little pinhole-sized, bright light scattered across the page. It usually begins with just one, or two, and becomes several over time. It's distracting to reading. In a conventional book, it would be like having a small speck of dirt on the page. If these little things don't bother you, then it's not an issue. The Paperwhite models don't seem to have this problem as often as the Voyage does. I went through 3 Voyage models before surrendering and returning to the Paperwhite. The Paperwhite has fewer total lights, so it's not as evenly lit as the Voyage, however, it's nothing significant.",3.0
It's a great tablet for the price. I bought it as a gift and they loved it.,3.0
"I had such a good experience with Amazon D batteries that I ordered some of their 2A batteries. The 2A batteries seemed much weaker out of the box. When I changed out a pair in my clock today, they had leaked and were stuck together. Making it difficult to remove them. I looked at the packaging for the new ones and noticed that they were made in Indonesia. After reading the reviews, it seems like it may be a matter of luck whether you get really good batteries for the price or really bad batteries at any price. I like to play blackjack so I will probably order one more time to see how lucky I get.",3.0
Cant answer as well as Amazon wish i had waited and bought Amazon,3.0

the first one I got was very slow. I turned it in today and this one works great,3.0
We have an echo dot in my son's room and bought this for the kitchen. I'm not sure why this is so much more but has the same functionality. I wish we would have bought another dot instead!,3.0
Great for small gadgets and remotes. Don't expect to run anythinh more. Could handle a set of battery power hair clippers.,3.0
Received Echo as a Bday present. Returned and purchase the Dot.Saved about $150. Love the Dot.,3.0
Good tablet simple to use and easy to learn and also great price,3.0
I'm disappointed that it doesn't have a mirror display mode.,3.0
Don't have much storage...ok for kids. Purchase tablet as a gift but didn't last long,3.0

Works well but after memory builds it starts acting up. Shuts on and off randomly. But for the price it's ok.,3.0

"This is the first time that I've used a Kindle tablet. I've used Android and Apple devices before, and this is a different beast. People that are used to an Android experience, will not be thrilled with this device. Even though it looks like Android, the Play Store is not available and not all of the basic apps are included in the Kindle Store. If I had to do it all over again I'd spend an extra $50 or $60 and get an actual Android tablet.",3.0
Good tablet to purchase for a first time tablet user.,3.0
My kids get kind of lost when they use this product. It does have everything but is not as user-friendly as I hoped it would be.,3.0
The price was great for these batteries but they don't last for very long. For some items they don't work at all. It's like they just don't have a lot of power. I will not be getting these again.,3.0
"Got the nieces, wife, and myself these for Christmas. Figures they were cheap enough, so why not.These are functional tablets in every way. We haven't found any problem with them. The display isn't a hi resolution, so I wasn't expecting great. I've had phones and tablet with the same resolution, but never one that looked quite as lack luster as this display. They are OK for the kids to beat around with because they broke the last tablet they had. This one probably wont last much longer, but it's cheap. I wish I would have spent a few more bucks and gotten better ones for my wife and I, though.If you want a disposable tablet or color reader for magazines and such, you'll probably be OK with this.If you want a good tablet, think about buying a good tablet.",3.0
Sorry to say I've been disappointed with these. They didn't last as long in my remotes and RC transmitters as even other store brand alkaline batteries.,3.0
In my opinion this model is too small and feels cheap. And sd card slot.,3.0
"It's great for beginners, like children, but very limiting for me. I can't use many apps because it doesn't allow me to use the Google play store.",3.0
"My old Kindle stopped charging, after 4 years, so I got the Fire to replace it. I really only needed a reader and that is how I use it. The battery runs down MUCH faster than my old Kindle. the price was right so I guess it will work fine.",3.0

Great durability and long lasting at portion of price,3.0
it does not charge any faster than regular charger.,3.0

"I bought and returned this item. I was hoping to be able to watch different sports games via the internet with the Amazon Fire TV but everything I selected stated it wasn't available. After trying different things for a few days, I figured I wasn't going to get the results I wanted and returned the unit.",3.0
Good tablet for reading books you love... still need to get used to it since all I have used in the past are apple products .,3.0
Not bad for an entry-level tablet. Pretty much what I expected for the price I paid for it. My four-year-old loves it,3.0
"So I was excited to get this when Best Buy started caring them. The thrill for was short lived. First week was fun to use it for music, weather, cooking, and jokes. But after that I lost interest. Attaching to my Hue lights and Nest were a longer process to make it work. I'd rather pull my phone out. Plus with a 2 story house it is useless if not on the same floor. Maybe I'll buy it again or a 2nd version when its released",3.0
"This is definitely not an iPad or a high end tablet. Nevertheless, for the discounted price that i paid on it (so, less than $50), it is well worth getting. I wanted something bigger while waiting for the next iPad Air to come out, and this fits the bill for paying little and getting a basic low end tablet. It is geared towards Amazon media consumption, ad it does that decently even with a screen resolution less than HD. If the sale comes back again where it is $15 off, I would not hesitate to recommend it again.",3.0
Find these batteries have to be replaced more frequently than other bands when used in the same application/device.,3.0
It does what it is supposed to do.,3.0
"I got this because my fire stick always gives a warning that it is too hot. Haven't had this problem but did experience problem. I have my ps4, apple tv, running through a hdmi switch. no problem when I had the fire stick plugged in. The amazon TV will not work with the switch. For it to work it needs to be connected directly. I have three tv's and three different switches didn't work on any and yes I tried different chords. Other than that works great.",3.0
It is okay does what it is suppose to amazon is kind of annoying but otherwise good buy,3.0
"This reader is purely for the person that simply wants an e-book reader, and very little else.",3.0
Don't last very long.,3.0
Good tablet althought the availability of apps thru their appstore is limited.,3.0
meh. it works. i find it difficult to navigate. i also have an ipad mini. this seems to be less intuitive than the ipad.,3.0
"Slow connecting, basic model, still a good product just not very advanced",3.0
This tablet is great for minimal use for a child. It is slow so I wouldn't recommend it for an adult.,3.0
Better quality then most tablets in same price range. I still suggests the accident protection plan or at least a okay case for it. Ads on lock screen is a bit of a let down but it functions like its supposed to.,3.0
"Bought this as a cheaper alternative for using with kids. Battery lasts longer than most tablets, the reason why I gave this such a mediocre rating is because you can't put a wallpaper for the lock screen. You always have an ad for something Amazon related, which can be annoying. But if it's just something small for the kiddos to use, good choice. I wouldn't recommend for adults.",3.0
"so far it's a nice toy in the kitchen, and it appears that there is a lot of up and coming apps that will be nice once they are all working. right now it can only do basic stuff. the speaker on it is just ok, they could improve that on the next upgrade. i don't even think it's stereo.",3.0
It's a good tablet for the value. Downside is there's no Google Play Store access. So you're limited to apps in the Amazon app store.,3.0
These batteries are just a tiny bit too short to work in every AAA device. Beware.,3.0
"Love this kindle as its light, user friendly and great purchase",3.0
"I bought a first generation Kindle Fire a few years back, when it was on sale for something like 185.00 and loved it. It took a bit of a beating and I had recently begun to think about buying a replacement. I think that original tablet would probably be more comparable to the Fire HD 10 or something. So my experience with this version is colored by the higher quality first generation model. I also use a Surface Pro tablet as my personal/work computer, so that too probably color my opinion. Out of the box this is lighter than the original. Upon powering up, the original bookshelf carousel is now replaced by a more standard tablet home screen. In terms of processing speed this version feels a little slow. Games I had on the original seem to struggle a bit on the new Fire. Web-browsing is not terrible but is not terribly fast either. In the end, if you want a good e-reader on a budget with a few extra features, this is a great buy. If you're looking for a serious small tablet, you may wish to add a bit more to your budget and get one of the older siblings.",3.0
"The Echo is ok, it's a decent speaker and I like that it has a Bluetooth so I can listen to music off my phone.But there is more that I don't like then I like.For example, to play music off spottily you must have a perineum account ($10 a month).I heart radio will play only the last station it had on, not sure yet but can't change station with just voice.Most of ""skills"" are done poorly, for example my Honeywell thermostat, you can't ask it to tell you the temp, turn on, turn off.Only thing that can be done, is to ask it to raise or drop the temperature.At this time it will not control my wifi sprinkler system ""orbit Bhyve"".You don't always get an answer to questions as it uses Bing as a search engine, which I'm not a big fan of .Tried to buy wifi light switches so I can have it controlling that, but after purchasing the Wemo switch I found out that all the switches in my house are 2 way switches, so that did not work.So basically it's just ok, and maybe in few years it will be better, but over all like I said there is more that I don't like about it.",3.0
Batteries seem to work in some flashlights and not others. They are just okay. Other batteries that we have will work on all. Not impressed.,3.0
The screen size could be bigger like the earlier versions of kindle.,3.0
"The price is something you can't beat... but it can be misleading.Pretty much every function and app required you to buy something, not much you can do for free. But still worth it for such low price.",3.0
It is ok,3.0
I buy a lot of these. I don't think that the longevity is exceptional but they are inexpensive in bulk. Worry about recycle maybe need to consider rechargeables,3.0
"The Amazon Fire reminds me of a cheap older Android tablet from 5 years ago. The camera is horrible, the screen is full and I'd rather play with fire than to use the, Amazon Fire. Im returning ASAP!",3.0
"I purchased the Amazon echo a little over a month ago. I like the concept of the echo but unfortunately it's not as responsive as I had hoped. Trying to get local news is nearly impossible. It's also not in sync with my Amazon account. Packages I ordered on Amazon that are delivered, it will still tell me are still in route. I think the speaker is a decent quality and I stream music quite often. I probably would not buy it again. Too expensive for the limited things it can do. Again, I like the concept but it still needs a lot of improvements.It's advertised as though it will make your life easier but other than creating a shopping list for me, I have not had an overwhelming life enhancing experience.",3.0
A few problems with games loading but over all good,3.0
I have bought multiple fire tablets and will continue too. I would advise to get the protection plan for any problems and we have had a few. The tablets work good for the most part but I would upgrade the memory to 16 if you are going to play a lot of games.,3.0
"Bought this for Christmas 2015. After about 9-10 months the battery began to fail to hold a charge. While the first 9 months were good -- as many of the reviews here laud this tablet -- the 90 day warranty is disappointing from Amazon. (When I did have a different Amazon device fail within the warranty period, their exchange was immediate and easy for a brand new device -- so the only warranty issue is with the length.)I'd recommend it if you just want a cheap tablet to throw in your bag but otherwise it's just average.",3.0
"Took it out of the box and played with it for a while. Then I lost connection with it and now it no longer recognizes my phone #. Called Amazon they said they would work on the problem, no call back yet.",3.0

"I was excited to expand more into the AmazonBasics brand since all previous purchases have been very well received. However, these batteries were not optimal for devices that are constantly on. We used them in gaming controllers for XBox and each set of 2 would make it about 1 day of constant family gaming/TV usage.It's very possible we received a bad batch but due to going through the entire pack in just 2 weeks compared to other brands I will have to steer clear from these in the future.",3.0
The Kindle is better than the older version in the fact that I have used it a lot with game apps for the kids and it was bogged down with memory being used up but I held out on purchasing a new one the scores and in app purchases won't transfer to the new one so I got the new one and it works fast updates apps camera is not so good but all and all 3 stars,3.0
"I have the Kindle Fire HD, so when i bought this i expected something up to that caliber or better. Sadly, it did not. In my opinion the older one is better in sound quality. The new one is lighter, but I did pay less for it.",3.0

Initially I bought this for my son and he's been using it everyday with a protective cover since my purchase my only issue I have really with the unit is that the charging port is in a horrible position and it's very difficult to insert the charger easily I may have a defective unit which I may have to return since the charging port is quite loose the price was right but quality could be a little better,3.0

"Tablet is ok. It does display ads on the lock screen, that you can't opt out of, to my knowledge. But for the price, I can't really complain. I bought it at the $35 BF price. I wouldn't let me download Instagram for some reason either.",3.0
"The built quality is great taking into considerarions its price. The tablet is pretty fast and responsive. However, Amazon's operating system is horrible. I miss a lot of apps that I use in my Apple devices, and some others that just don't work as good such as Mint and Netflix (don't have download capability). Also it won't work with my Chromecast devices...",3.0

Got 1 of this when it 1st came out. Returned the unit coz it won't boot up. Advantage buying from Bestbuy easy exchange or return. The second unit that i got works perfectly.,3.0
"I primarily use these for my noise cancelling headphones and wireless mouse. Overall, for the price, this is an okay product.

Not enough features. It's to simple. When parental control is on it's not much you can do on the tablet not even use the camera,3.0
"BETTER THAN NOTHING, But not as good as the CASE LOGIC: ELS-111 11 Chromebook/Surface 3 Sleeve. Fits the MacAir 11.6 perfect. The Amazon sleeve is simply neoprene, which snags and has so much friction, it doesn't easily slide in/out of my backpack. The Amazon quality is decent, but looks like a beer can cozy (koozie) compared to the CASE LOGIC. The CASE LOGIC IS NOT just NEOPRENE! It is highly protective, light, low density foam encased in canvas. It's more durable and slide in and out of my backpack better. Also the CASE LOGIC opens on two sides not just a slit on one side like the Amazon.(I bought both, and tried to return the AmazonBasics, yet Amazon was going to charge me 8.34 to send it back.. so i am keeping it.. Don't waste your time.. Don't make my mistake, buy the CASE LOGIC ELS-111 11 (note: last photo of Case Logic sleeve)",3.0

"Kindle Fire is a decent tablet. The only turn off is the way Amazon has massacred the Android OS and makes it incompatible with chromecast most of the time. It's a great tablet for reading and saving media on the go. Other than the OS, Kindle Fire is a decent buy.",3.0
"The music was good, however, Alexa's voice was inaudible most of the time. It couldn't meet our needs so we returned it.",3.0

The show has some nice features but the audio quality isn‚Äôt the best for the price point. I got mine on sale and am just using it for a bedroom alarm clock. I can read the time without my glasses.I still use my Sonos Play 1 to listen to my sleep playlist and ny other music. Unless I missed something it seems like if I set the volume low at night to listen to music to go to sleep my alarm will not be loud enough. So I don‚Äôt use the Show for music much.,3.0

It is the top of the line e reader by amazon which is also the leader in e readers. The voyage is an excellent device and very versatile to carry on your trips. I feel the premium for the page turn sensors is little too high. In hindsight I would go with the paper white and save a few bucks.,3.0

"I bought this tablet for my son. He used it for mainly games. I though he would like reading his books on it but he prefers the actual book vs digital books.

"I'm mostly happy, but like so many electronics, this one has a huge of built in advertising that you just can't get away from. There is no way to identify the aps you want to see first, and it always defaults the first click to an advertised movie for sell. It takes many clicks to get where I want, and the voice only works for purchases from Amazon, everywhere else you have to use the keyboard using clicks.",3.0
"A great price, to be sure...but EVERY flameless candle I have put these into has been very dim. When I replaced with Duracell (and local grocery store brand as well) the candles are noticeably brighter. Don't think I'll be buying AmazonBasics batteries again soon -- which is a bummer. I have always been impressed with Amazon-brand products but these batteries are all that.",3.0

"The three star review is for the situation described here, not the quality of the unit. I ordered this online and picked it up in store. The package was very securely sealed the seals appeared to be factory. The Echo was wrapped in plastic and looked like it had never been out of the package. When I hooked it up, however, it said that the unit was registered to someone else. It wasn't a problem to get it registered to me and the unit works fine. I spoke to both Amazon and Target about this, and neither could tell me what happened. I was offered an exchange if I wished. I chose to keep the original unit, but I wanted to make others aware of the issue. I have one theory. Target has a buyer who purchased a lot of these for Target resale, and they are all registered to this person. I guess I'll never know. The Echo itself works fine and I'm very happy with it. After you hook it up, make sure to go to settings and download the latest updates. Then you should be good to go.",3.0

"I bought 2 of these tablets for my two youngest children. They had a lot of options to chose from as far as children apps go, but they were already familiar with the iPad since they stole mine all the time. Lol.

I haven't really kept track meticulously but these batteries don't seem to last as long as Kirkland brand or Duracell.,3.0
"I'd say for the price it was a decent Tablet it did what I needed it to do but the support I'd say through the App side was a bit rather weak which is the big downfall of this tablet. Amazon also does a lot of advertisements on the tablet for example the lock screen and multiple pages on your home screens which can be rather annoying and unremoveable. Otherwise I used it to watch videos, surf the web and use a few social media apps. Good for kids too both videos and games side. So I'd say in general for the price it's a decent tablet, but if you are looking to do more and have a smoother tablet you might want to pay more for something better.",3.0

"it's just ok for a tablet, it doesn't have google play store of course which limits a wide variety. I would think by now they would offer most of the play store apps but nope. It's slow and browser doesn't load pages with flash or graphics good. poor camera. but it functions ok for a cheap tablet. i didn't expect a lot, but did expect better from kindle.",3.0
It was a cool device but my main issue that it couldn‚Äôt play playlists the I had stored on the sonos app. It only played streaming services,3.0
It's good for lil kids n small stuff . Doesn't look very fast,3.0
"Got 3 of them, great cost for what you get. My kids are down to only one left. Killed 2 of them sadly. Setting up can be a pain. Kids keep asking to add more apps. You have to delete the old to add more. I'm starting to dislike them more then the kids like them.",3.0
Good price for batteries except it seems like they don't last near as long as name brand,3.0
The media player is compact and low profile. The remote is nice. The unit/remote freeze up quite often requiring the player to be unplugged to reset it. This may be due to the fact I am running Kodi. I do have a first generation firestick with Kodi that does not freeze up like this unit. The performance differences between the firestck and this unit are negligible in my opinion.,3.0
"One of the simplest tablets probably out there, only good for those that want to get into Amazon.com shopping. Good value for bargain proce.",3.0
Over all the product is good and works as advertised but lately it is constantly having issues keeping enet connection and even worse has issues updating. We were told this is a larger amazon network issue.,3.0
These don't seem to hold a charge as well as the major brands.,3.0
"Gets the job done as a tablet I guess, apps are limited but this isn't meant to be a full on tablet, its a reader. It does freeze ad glitch a little but for the price I guess its worth it.",3.0

Great price for these alkaline batteries. Being that they are AAA there is not much of a power drain for devices like remote control. I found that the AA amazon basic batteries will not last as long as as you named brand alkaline batteries.,3.0
"Works as advertised. However, I can't imagine why Amazon doesn't include it with the Kindle. I know of no other product that does not supply an item that is essential to its use. Amazon should include this with the Kindle. So, remember, add the price of one of these to the price of the Kindle to get the real price of the Kindle. That is why I gave it three stars. Come on Amazon, stop the misleading pricing on the Kindle.",3.0
"I purchased this box in hopes of using it for the new Playstation Vue service which it did run pretty well. It does everything they say it does but one of the main issues I had with the original and still have with this is the interface. The layout for the main screen and the ads they throw in your face are just ridiculous. After using Roku for years, the Nvidia Shield TV, and the new Apple TV I would recommend any of those over this device any day. They offer a much cleaner interface and more functionality for the most part (except playstation vue).",3.0

"A little disappointed with my first experience with AI. You have to learn to communicate with Alexa to get results. I feel like she should have to learn more about me than I her. However I understand she is a GEN 1 and would expect that future versions will closer be to the Jetsons than something that keeps telling me ""I didn't understand what you said""! I doubt Amazon will update the existing units with better technology they will want to you to buy it all over again instead of making a loyal or invested customer happy. She does have a lot knowledge you just have to figure how to ask for it or download an additional skill/Application.",3.0

"Requires too many components. Cameras, etc. stick with basics (in my opinion).",3.0
"The Echo is not very good at answering questions. It is good at playing music and telling you the weather. I'm sure it will get better, but it is more of an annoyance with a toddler in the house. It does tell cute jokes, but it says ""I'm sorry I can't find that answer"" more often than not. The sound is quite good from this model, and works well with Spotify.",3.0
It's a really cool device with a ton of apps but it often will freeze if left on to long,3.0
Weird but some didn't last long as they should,3.0
"This tablet screen and memory is lackluster at best but other than that if you are replacing another one of the Kids tablets or giving a gift to an older family member this is the way to go. The video on Amazon website shows a better picture while streaming video, Amazon ""One touch"" is turned on automatically so be careful to password protect purchases unless you don't mind a lot of $2.99 purchases. In short they make it too easy to purchase items by mistake. I thought I was on Prime video and notice that I was charged for an episode of Warehouse 13. Since I didn't see the show and caught this quickly I was able to chat with Amazon Customer Care and they walked me through how to change that setting online. This tablet not for me since I'm looking for a higher end media tablet with more memory than the 8GB this unit has.",3.0

Got this on sale for 35 bucks I think. My I phone is faster and works better on most things but couldn't beat the price. Serve its purpose for occasional use and games.,3.0
The main reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it's no iPad. It will be great for kids mostly. The screen quality is not the best.,3.0
Good beginner tablet for older person who likes surf Internet.,3.0

"Good tablet. Easy to use for 5 yr. Not as many free stuff as expected. Have to pay for most games, movies and books.",3.0
Mostly good for shopping lists and listening to music getting game scores etc. Hopefully will have real search functions in the future. Easy setup. Phone app,3.0
"I like the reader, nice and small. What i don't like is if you have a very secure wifi system at home, it does not let you set it up. I had to go to my daughters house and set it up. That is a bit alarming. It should be more secure since the only way we can put items on there is by putting our information on it that can be compromised. Make it more secure and easy to put protection on it. That is the only reason I didn't make it a 5 star product.",3.0
"If you're just going to read and play a game or two, maybe surf the internet a bit, this is an ok tablet. But if you are a heavy user, I'd tell you to pass on this tablet because it won't keep up with your surfing/games/e-mail.",3.0

"Looking for a streaming media box? This is a fine android based one..it has an Ethernet port, streams, does 1080p, Amazon, and if you have all android stuff it's fine..I really don't like that it doesn't have a volume control..the only difference between this and the fire stick (for me) is the internal storage capacity, and the Ethernet port..so but two fire sticks instead of one box, unless you want to play the apps",3.0

Data is tied to skills and should just be a blanket open forum of knowledge. Still has other benefits to explore.,3.0
"I loved this thing until it was time to go to bed. Although it dims, the lowest setting is still very bright--like sleeping with a flashlight in your face. I hope they make fixes that will allow the screen to dim more. Also, not crazy about having a camera connected to the Internet on my nightstand. If you cover it up, the motion sensor then won't work. The sound is OK--not quite as good as the non-screen Echo--maybe because it's not omni-directional like the regular Echo. My enthusiasm for this device has subsided quite a bit because of these issues.",3.0

"We're an unplugged family - multiple devices (Kindles, iPads, Roku, etc.) - so we're pretty familiar with this sort of tech. Fire TV works okay, but the remote has started giving me problems and we've only had the product for about 6 months. Our Roku 3, which we've had for over a year, is much smoother and hasn't given us any problems. We also use a Chromecast, which also seems to be less quirky than the FireTV. I have a PS3 in the same room as the FireTV and I find myself going to the PS3 when the FireTV starts to annoy. Unless you're looking for a device that can also run Kodi, I'd strongly recommend the Roku 3 over the FireTV.",3.0

"Great value for the money. However, the operating system is a bit clunky. Constant notifications and messages to delete. Some can be turned off, other seem to just keep appearing. The reader app surprisingly is less than intuitive.",3.0
This is an average performance tablet and amazon centric. This tablet could have been better if amazon would have made it with android os instead of poorly designed fire OS. The app store and apps in that are not great. This tablet can be good for people who wants to read while travel or play some games while travel will be good. I paid only 35$ so cant complain for the price i paid. I already have ipad mini 2 and comparing with that makes this tablet little slow.,3.0

Decent tablet. I knew it wouldn't be fast but it does get the job done and it was relatively cheap.,3.0
Everything worked well and a little faster than the 7 inch but a little harder to hold with one hand. Ended up returning and keeping the 7 inch tablet instead as it was better for me. Still a great deal,3.0

Good tablet but not as smooth as high end tablets. It's limited to Amazon so don't expect to do as much as an Android or iPad. I like mine and will continue to use it. I recommend using one if you can before buying.,3.0
"Not as good as before the old kindle, just seams to work better",3.0
Would recommend for the right person that wants low cost tablet BUT...Ended up returning this item because it was heavy and too wide for my hand to hold. It was too big to hold in hand and too small to use like a larger tablet. Ended up just using my Lenovo Yoga 900 since it was more flexible and only about .5 lb heavier.,3.0

"I got this tablet for my 20 month old son. He constantly wants my phone or iPad to watch YouTube kids videos. He can work both of these apple devices all on his own. I figured he was ready for his own tablet, hoping he'd leave mine alone. No luck. The Fire is not as user-friendly as my iPhone. Even on the child setting it is not easy to use. The surface is not as responsive to touch. He gets frustrated with it and puts it down after a few minutes of trying. Now his daddy uses it and he still goes after my iPad and phone. If you want a tablet for your toddler, just get an iPad.",3.0
works great once I figured it out. Books are easy to download.,3.0

Just normal batteries a little higher priced than I could get elsewhere,3.0

Not the greatest for productivity but it's very good at entertaining kids at a cheap price.,3.0
"I bought three of these as christmas gifts for my grand-sons ages 3,6,11. I didn't think about the type of playstore available for them to get games.

One of them has to be returned as it will not hold a charge which has been frustrating for the child who is trying to play his games.",3.0
"I had a lower end kindle for years. When that broke, I decide to buy the higher end one that is backlit. The back litghting is nice for reading at night.

I don't know if I'd buy this one over the lowest end one again.",3.0
"This is a good tablet, but mainly for readers. There are a lot of apps for books, and such...but there are other apps you can download.",3.0

The first one I had didn't know the SD card was there after shutting it off. They were great about sending me a new one but now I have to call them back and tell them what is going on now. I prefer to use my old Android tablet. It also won't let me remove the password or I have to take off the free time. I have to call them and see what I can do about that. It is for her and not really for me anyway. Why do I have to have a password for everything? Not too impressed but a really good buy. The ads, when you turn it on, don't bother me at all and was worth saving the $20.",3.0
"Just like the reviews said, the Netflix app buffers every few minutes...AWFUL.....now I only have to glimpse that spinning red circle and my blood pressure rises.

works great for the price.but it shoves amazon stuff down your hroat like the fire tv.and is linked to your amazon 1 click buy if you haveit set up that way.,3.0

"I'm ambivalent about this tablet. It's a great price point and the picture quality is amazing. It's great for watching Netflix. But, you are locked in to only the apps available on Amazon.

Noticed short life and not enough power for some items,3.0
I have owned the product for about a month and it is as advertised. The case only opens about a third of the way. I have always had computer bags that opened fully.

"It is a neat gadget; can do some things like track items for a shopping list and setting timers that are great. I would have expected it to be better at telling me things like when is TV show X on and what sound does a Cardinal (bird) make. All were met with ""I didn't understand the question."" Alexa should be more intuitive than that and should learn and grow as you go along, she does not. You also have to ask things in a way Alexa will understand. For example, you cannot say, ""Alexa, turn out the lights in the kitchen."" That ""does not compute."" But if you say, ""Alexa, shut off the lights."" She will do as you ask. I had to start writing down the ""correct"" way to ask her things so I would remember them. Again she needs to learn and adapt; not happening so far.",3.0

"I really wanted to love the Amazon AA batteries but they just are not durable enough for my usage. As a night time long distance runner, I have LED headlamps with a rear red flashing light that I use which require 3 AA batteries.I usually purchase Duracell or Energizer batteries in bulk and they have worked well. Rechargeable batteries are not very good in LED Headlamps so those are out.The problem with the Amazon batteries is that I get about 8 or 9 hours of strong light, then it really fades fast. The longest I have used the Amazon batteries is 11 hours and by then, the light is less than 40 brightness. The other issue I noticed with these batteries is that the front headlight will lightly flash in time with the rear light once the front brightness is reduced. When I test the batteries with a tester, they are only 1/2 way through the green range.Duracell and Energizers give me nearly 16 - 18 hours at full brightness and maybe 3 or 4 hours with 40. I have not seen the light flashing when the brightness drops on the these batteries. When I test the batteries after the light is reduced, they are in the yellow or red area.The Amazon Batteries give me two less than the Energizers and Duracells which is significant. I average 5 night time runs with the Duracells and Energizers and 2, sometimes 3 with Amazon Batteries.These may be perfect in remote controls and other static use devices, but if it has to drive a light or a motor, you may want to skip these.The light pictures show new, 5 and 9 hours.The 2nd light shows new and 4 hours.The battery tester shows new, 4, 8 and 11 hours.",3.0

"The Paperwhite is certainly better than the regular Kindle, primarily due to the back lighting feature. If you buy a Kindle eReader, this would be the one to buy. You could spend more for the higher end models but there's really no need. The main issue with this eReader is the smudge effect at the bottom of the screen. I tried two Paperwhites and both had the same issue. Perhaps this is just how they are.",3.0
"Alexa works great for listening to spotifly (only if you have premium) and very basic information (time, weather). She has a tough time answering questions. This is not a Google machine. She consistently would not understand simple questions. The volume is very loud and can be adjusted manually or through voice. She also can learn skills which some are hit and miss. I'd still recommend this product if you have a smart home (smart outlets, locks) or if you have spotifly premium.",3.0

"An 'okay' reader. Reading from an iPad mini is better under all conditions except outside in sunlight. Plus, with the iPad you can play games, web search, etc. The Kindle library function is not nearly as good as the Kindle app on the iPad where you can see many more of your books on a page and scroll through them all quickly versus the slow swipe function of the Kindle. I also do not like the page turn of the Kindle versus Apple. Every page turned on Kindle is like slow motion and about every fifth page refreshes entirely. I actually have to go to the top of the next page slowly in order to not have to wait for the Kindle slow page turn. Even the reading in the outdoors feature of the Kindle is not as great as reviewers indicate as there is still the sun glare on pages that you have to deal with, although at least you can read with it outdoors. The Kindle also suffers from a 'shadow' along the bottom of the screen. The explanation is that it is actually a shadow that is between the lights that are shining upward for night time reading. Draw your own conclusions as to whether that is good engineering. It is worse on some of the devices I saw than on others. Kindle serves the purpose for reading at the beach and not worrying if it accidently gets damaged. I would never take an iPad to the beach, but the Kindle is almost 'disposable' in contrast. Maybe 3 stars is being a bit generous but it is a good supplement to the iPad. If Apple ever makes their device so it can be used outside without a glare, then I don't see any market for the Kindle at that point. Not sorry I have a Kindle, but for what I decided to buy it for (reading at beach) it is at the price point where it is not really worth it. I still read ""paper"" books for those who remember what those are and those still work perfectly for beach reading.",3.0

"It's a decent tablet, but keep the following in mind:- if you get this for your kids to share your amazon prime account for video and game apps, you have to lock it to prevent accidental purchases. Problem is that this prevents free app and video purchases, and you have to okay every thing they do. - if you allow them access to apps and video, then that can purchase anything without limits.On top of this, they lock out the google app store and refuse to even allow access to google drive. While you can hack it to add these basic features, you will need a modicum of technical knowledge to do so.So, it's useful, but a pain too. Your needs may vary.",3.0
"They are ok - I haven't had any arrive DOA, but they really don't seem to work for very long. In an Xbox One controller, they last about half the time that a set of duracells would. I don't think they're terrible, but I doubt I'll buy them again. You can frequently catch Duracells on Newegg at about 30 per 100. Yes, it's a bit more than the amazon basics per battery, but you'll get a lot more usage out of each pair.",3.0

"Bought this for my parents as they have an aging 3rd Generation FireHD. That tablet cost well over $300 dollars but was limited to fireOS 4. I couldn't believe that their newest only cost $50 on sale with ads. I don't think it is worth it at their normal price of $80 dollars.FireOS 5 is pretty much just a skinned version of Android Lolipop. Since we are on Nougat now, they are about two years behind. Hopefully security updates are still being made for the device.The biggest disappointment was the screen. If you buy this for reading books, they really need to go back to the old 3/4 Gen HD Fire Tablets, as their screens are so much better. They claim IPS on this screen, but I don't buy it. Colors are washed out and pixel density is pretty poor.The blue light filter they have is pretty terrible compared to what Apple offers. It basically puts a semitransparent color over the entire screen. If something on the screen is already black, why does it need to look blackish orange? I don't fully fault amazon as this may be more of a limitation of Android, but still...Also I can't figure out how to get rid of the adds for the red version. In the past there was an option to pay a few extra dollars and they remove the promotion. Amazon's website doesn't offer the red without adds as of this writing, but they do with the black.Side load google play store for more up to date apps as a lot of the amazon store apps are long out of date.",3.0

"Pro: Relatively inexpensive, although I did end up waiting almost two weeks for delivery.Cons: High drop-out rate.

I purchased 3 (2 as gifts) recently believing all prior purchases would be compatible with the Paperwhite. I was highly disappointed to learn that interactive solitaire and word games I played on the old Kindle Touch were lost.,3.0
If you are looking for an inexpensive tablet that can keep up with everyday casual use then this tablet is a good buy.,3.0
"This tablet is OK, sometimes it's kind of slow. Loads for a while before opening app. Storage has been good. 32 GB. I gave my son the freedom to download any game he wanted on prime time. And after 2 months he still has like 3gb left of space. Not recommend for kids over 10 years old. My son is 4 and sometimes he gets mad because tablet gets slow. Still good deal for 32gb, 1 year primetime for $80",3.0
This was bought for my daughter and it works great with her but I wouldn't recommend it for anything intense.,3.0
Compared to the initial kindle this is a big impovement. Great for the Black friday promotional price.,3.0
Bought it for my mom so we can stay in touch and she could play crossword games or Bingo at her Nursing home. She needs alot of assistance,3.0
Well not as good as I thought but works fine for my children.,3.0
Responds quickly. Hears my command from quite a distance. If you buy into google schedule (monthly fee) it helps you keep track of appointments birthdays etc.,3.0
"When companies play nice with each other... the customers win. This product is fairly novel if you aren't completely bought in to the Amazon ecosystem. I would use it way more if they played nice with Apple services. I know it's a competitor, but if both companies goals are to build an awesome product for a customer, they should play nice.",3.0

You need to have amazon prime plus order a special music plan. Disappointing for sure. The sound is ok. I think the larger model is probably better.,3.0
"So I love my electronics. I have an Ipad but when I saw this on sale I got myself one just to have since I am a prime member I figured I could use this too. The only thing I like about this is that you an expand the the storage. If the Ipad had that option it would be amazing. So since I then expanded the memory I can have more movies to watch offline. Camera is horrible, So I would say if you have a younger child, this may be decent but nothing compares to an ipad.",3.0
"This is not appreciably faster than any other 1.8 or higher amp charger when used with my Kindle, Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD, various Android tablets, and other devices that have USB charging cables.It also blocks an adjacent outlet. Why didn't they put the plug on the short end like the original black-and-white Kindle chargerIt is an exceptionally good deal when purchased together with a Kindle Fire HD on promotion, but the regular price is not competitive for a supposedly premium charger.Additionally, it does not come with a cable, an omission that many people won't realize.**EDIT** I appreciate the many comments, but Amazon promotes this charger as something that charges faster than other chargers, but I haven't seen any such advantage. At promotional prices, it's a good deal, but not at almost twenty dollars. Otherwise, look elsewhere.**EDIT** When the review was written, the description of the item did not have this statement Optimized for Kindle tablets: PowerFast is a 9W charger and will charge your Kindle tablets faster than the white 5W Kindle charger will. That line was added a considerable amount of time after I wrote my review.",3.0

Love these BUT 2 of the 4 packages were NIT warm lights. They are really super bright cold white. Can't use them.,3.0
I returned the item because itt was not wireless. It always needed to be plugged in in order to work. Otherwise it was a great product. I was looking for something that could be taken from level to level as well as outside with ease.,3.0
I already had an iPad and just bought this to see what all the fuss was about. Haven't used it hardly ever.,3.0
"I got the tablet for $50 but doesn't have the full Android operating system. Even with a software hack, not all the apps from Play Store were usable on this tablet. Returned it and got a Samsung Tablet.",3.0

"We 2 Amazon Fire's for our kids for Christmas. We chose these because product reviews were good and the price was decent compared to other electronic pads. Since having them, they have been decent, but not great. The kids will turn them on to play games and their home screens don't always appear; sometimes when they want to play a game that is already downloaded, the pad acts like it needs to re-download the game; and there is a lot of frustration when all of the downloads start circling and they cannot do anything with their pads. Turning the pads completely off does not always help and sometimes, we cannot even get them to turn off. When they do work properly though, the kids love them. They are decent for a 1st time pad for kids for not a lot of money, but just keep in mind they can be frustrating at times.",3.0
Great tablet fast and great resolution. Great with prime membership,3.0
"I came across this on sale and couldn't pass it up. Turns out it runs slower than I expected though. My girlfriend has an older version of this model and it just seems to run smoother than this one. Still, a nice alternative for browsing/shopping/bill paying than wearing about my smartphone battery.",3.0
"Its a good tablet, screen is kind of weird but it does its job. I wish the it had more memory but for the price, I can't expect to much for a inexpensive tablet. But what I do love is that all the apps are free so that's a #SCORE. Great for kids",3.0
These batteries have a short life compared to other alkaline batteries that we use. They are definitely basic batteries. I will not order these again.,3.0
It is a lot more then I was after. I can watch my Netfix and do more,3.0
not what I was looking for but they are ok.,3.0
"On average, these batteries do not last as long as the Energizer. They cost less to buy, but overall, there isn't much saving.",3.0
Good for alittle ones for games and movies picture not so clear but not expensive,3.0
Not as good as the HDX but does well for $50. Also much slower than HDX. Screen is more pixelated than anticipated. Would probably spend more next time and get a quicker unit.,3.0
I would recommend this to anyone it quite compact and easy to use and it good for any age.,3.0
"DON'T RECHARGE THEM LIKE SERIOUSLY DON'T!!!! they work good and last but not for to long and when two of them died i decided to recharge them and it leaked all over my battery charger. my brother took a few and i had no idea he charged a few without a problem and he didn't get his stuff ruined but i did. So if I were you, don't charge them",3.0
"Good tablet but you could find a better one in market within same price range. The one thing I don't like is the brightness , it's poor.And amazon could have given a better FaceTime camera., that's really bad.",3.0
I bought this for my two year old grandson but the restrictions were too much.,3.0

"This device fulfill a daily needs. You can use for a very basic thing like browsing, listening the music, watching movie or reading. The quality of the picture and the sound is not too bad. If you are a vet picky person.. this device will not work for you. The only cons for me is that this device can't connect to Tv.",3.0
Well primarily I was going. To for a Samsung galaxy but for the price I went with this kindle for my daughter to use I do like the parental control features I just wish Amazon was a full android device instead of limitations to app markets I can't even get Google play. Unless you jail break it. Well for what it does it works fine just not the top of the list.,3.0

"After using IPAD, it is weird to see flickers while reading on a small screen. However, it was recommended by a friend of mine who thinks it is easy on eyes. Battery lasts long and you can download work related pdfs to read later. (my main purpose to buy was to read docs offline) Redundant if you have kindle on ipad/other tabs.",3.0
Batteries did not last anywhere near the length of the Duracell that we purchased. Did a side by side test and the Amazon batteries were down to 50 to where the Duracell batteries were still at 99. Will do some more testing to make sure the test were equal. We bought two new trail cameras and we put one set of Amazon's batteries in one camera and one set of the duracell batteries in the other. We will now switch the batteries in the cameras for the same time frame and see what the end result is.,3.0
"Their regular batteries, what else can I say about 'em.",3.0
not the longest lasting batteries. but they're batteries... we've gone through the package really quickly.,3.0
Battery dies after an hour...should last longer for the money. Will not bold charge.,3.0
"It's ok, it's good for beginner users, the kids love it because they could play games on it",3.0
My 8 pack batteries were NOT charged so if you are buying these for a trip or something be warned.,3.0
It's a great for reading books but it's not that great when it comes to everything else.,3.0
This is great for a connected home. People who use this should buy it if they plan on making everything in their home wi-if enabled. Otherwise it's an expensive SIRI.,3.0
Great sound for music. Use it for a reminder each day. Kind of a to do list. When I need time or temp just ask Alexa,3.0
I didn't know much about the device before buying other than the fun commercials. I figured that it was internet connected and could do anything I asked it to. I quickly learned this is not the case. You aren't able to just plug it in and expect it to know everything on the internet. It seemed it didn't know know some basic questions. It uses skills where are like phone APs. You have to enable each skill in order to use it. When you want to use a skill much like an ap you have to remember the specific skill and then Include that in what you ask it to do. It seems like it does home automation well and basic functions but it has a long way to go before it's a know everything on the internet,3.0
Couldn‚Äôt use it for video chat with amazon show .. that was the reason for me to buy this tablet. Will return back,3.0
"I'm not a techie, but after days of trying to hook up, I gave up. I don't know if it was the Echo Plus or my carrier ATT Uverse causing the issue, but it would NOT connect. So, back to the store it went. Even with checking out blogs on the internet for assistance...none of it worked.",3.0
Based on the price it is easy to see that this tablet is not something that will knock your socks off but is good for children that like to read books.,3.0
I have way more buffering with this device than I do with my Apple TV 4 gen. It works just not well. I have a glitch with this unit every time I use it. That indeed takes away from the user experience.,3.0
I would not purchase this item again as there is no 4K content.,3.0
"The old Fire TV's had an optical audio out S/PDIF, the new ones only have an HDMI output. Great if you have a new A/V setup that has HDMI pass-through on the receiver, not so good if you want to run video through HDMI and audio to your receiver.I should have probably considered a Roku.",3.0
"Traded in the Echo for Google Home after trying both. Did the training questions but still found it could only answer 6 of 10 questions. There were many specific apps but trying to remember the cues words is more difficult. Google home answers without cue words the first time and can extend a conversation based on the first question. Can ask for driving times to destinations without an app, same for getting a cocktail recipe. Very dry responses where GH has personality. Try them both before deciding what is best for your needs.",3.0
"Bought these for my 4 & 5 year Olds so I wasn't expecting top of the line performance, especially for 39 bucks.

Don't seem to last long. I think dollar general batteries are just as good.,3.0
"I mean... it work fine, but 20 fine There's nothing special here and it's a joke that Amazon doesn't just ship a charging plug with the Kindle in the first place. You should be able to find plenty of non-OEM chargers that'll work in terms of watts and voltage for far less money, like 5.",3.0

"This tablet is useful if you have prime and invest in the Amazon ecosystem. I prefer my other Android tablets more, but for the price I paid for this one it was a great deal.",3.0
The Freetime so far isn't very intuitive and it looks like you have to be on the deivce. No web interface for it.,3.0
They dont last as long as certain premium brands but they do OK. I wouldnt put them in critical apps like smoke detectors but for TV remotes and toys and all the other goofy modern distractions that regularly beg for AAs they are OK.,3.0
"The sales rep told me this kindle Fire tablet is easy to set up. Just follow the directions. Three hours later + a trip back to the store, a member of the Geek Squad finally got my e mail to work. He could not tell me why it was a problem. Also the camera quality is very poor. If you use it to check your e mails and browse the web, its fine. Other than that.... oh well.",3.0
"Overall it's a nice looking cover and does it's job well. It's simple, elegant and slick. When I say slick, I don't necessarily mean cleverly devised, I mean slippery. The smooth leather provides next to no grip on the cover. I have a tendency to hold things lightly, so I can just imagine this repeatedly slipping out of my hand. Sure it doesn't have a band/clasp/etc to keep it closed, but neither did Kindle 2's cover, and neither does nearly every book ever published.It's too expensive. I don't understand why Amazon is charging so much considering they'll be offering another cover with additional functionality for half the price (AmazonBasics Leather Folio Cover with Multi-Angle Adjustable Stand for Kindle Touch, Kindle (Black)).

Not easy to navigate and download apps to the device,3.0
It's a decent quality tablet for the money. One complaint is the speakers are weak. Have to cup my hand around the speaker side to get some good feedback. The Silk Browser seems to have issues with search engines. Just switching the search engine fixes it though.I got this for when the power goes out at my house. It's served to let me watch netflix. With a bluetooth keyboard it seems adequate for messaging and writing out notes.Video quality is good enough. Though that has more to do with not being super picky about it. I'm considering gifting my dad one of these this year. He commented that the quality looked good. Another complaint would be the amazon app store is limited. No Clash Royale. Which is the only mobile game I actually enjoy. I'm sure there's a way around this. But I'm really not interested in digging around for it. So for the most part it's a good solid low end tablet.,3.0

However, for the price there is very little competition among android tablets.",3.0
"I initially liked the product, the work it does and with the speakers. But then with time you feel bored, in specific if you are listener of hindi music as the songs are repetitive. Amazon Unlimited Music does not holds a very good library of Hindi Music. Secondly, Alexa is probably tuned to answer more of ""I don't know"". After purchasing, I realized and read more reviews that Google Home provides much better answers to queries put against it and has a wide range of hindi music.",3.0
"I bought this and an AppleTV at the same time. The FireTV is just kinda OK. The interface isn't that intuitive and could use some polish.

I have bought 3 of the amazon fire tv boxes. I love how many online services you can access via the fire. I would rate this a perfect 5 if it was not for the fact that the fire remote is so poorly made. 2 of the 3 remotes died before the batteries did. Sure you can use your phone to control the fire tv box but that is slow and should not have to be done. And dont try to get help from Amazon their idea of help is to have you buy a new fire tv box.,3.0

"You will find detailed reviews of kindle paper white online. I will cover some other general observations,If you send a pdf to your kindle email , it will sync it to your kindle. But the fonts appear small when you open it in kindle paper white and the menu option did not allow me to change font size. You have to convert the pdf to be able to adjust font size.You will be able to convert your existing pdfs by sending a email with ""Convert"" in subject line and including the attachment and sending it to your kindle email (refer to amazon settings for finding out your kindle email). However it may lose the tables or other code diagrams from the original pdf so that is a pain (varies from pdf to pdf). Also if you are used to ios or android, the page turns are not the same like flipping. when you tap or perform a page flip,It will blink for a sec and refresh the page to move to next page. I found this a little annoying but it works. if you buy a book online then that might be a better option as it will let you read the formatted content correctly.Battery usage is fantastic.Another positive is that the inbuilt lights are not glaring in the dark so you will find reading to be a pleasant experience.

"I ended up returning this tablet. For the price, $40, the tablet performed very well. However, if you have the money, do yourself a favor and step out of the Amazon lineup. The iPads are great, in my opinion the best, but they cost $$$$. From what I've experienced, the Samsung Tab A line is a solid tablet for a $$ budget. You can often find one on sale for ~$150 and its a pretty good bang-for-the buck.If the money is your ONLY concern, then this will probably work well enough for you.",3.0
"This product is great for reading you the news, a book or the weather. Alexa is great at setting timers and alarms and telling silly jokes. If you ask Alexa a ""google"" type question such as ""What was the score to 'such and such' college basketball game"", most times she cannot answer even if you pose the question a number of ways. Sometimes, you can ask a question differently from the way you would intuitively ask a question and Alexa will answer. This proves frustrating to me. It is a very expensive gadget that your phone can easily do with a few keystrokes. I am considering returning it and purchasing the google product to see if there is an improvement.",3.0

"These batteries are only OK. They don't last as long as Duracell and when they die, it's usually instantly. One moment they seem to work fine, the very next moment they are outputting half power. I would say that about half of these batteries just simply died while being used, no warning, no gradual loss of power, simply dead. They also seem to be marginally shorter than brand-name batteries, but to be honest, I haven't measured them. Suffice it to say I've decided that I would rather spend the few extra cents per battery on brand-name batteries. It's simply not worth the savings in my opinion.

I'm kind of upset at how fast it broke though, despite how good of a condition I tried to keep it in.",3.0
"This is not as cheap feeling as I thought it was going to be. It's definitely not in the iPad class but it's not bad for what it is. I ordered online and did not have one in my hands until mine arrived. Pros: The screen is decent, sound is loud enough for me, no lag scrolling and Real Racing 3 plays smoothly. Cons: The major down side is battery charging time, battery life and built in storage space. When it arrived, it was showing 76% remaining. After less than 2.5 hours use, it had to be charged. I just read where it can take 6 hours or longer to charge. My iPad Air 2 can fully charge in a few hours from 0%. Built in storage is not enough. Yes you can get micro SD cards however some apps will only install on the built in storage. Also, you can not delete Amazon apps without voiding the warranty. And unless I'm missing something, you can't move them either.So if you are looking for something to use casually for web surfing, email, watching movies, reading books and the occasional game, this should be just fine...keeping in mind the battery life and lack of built in storage. But you won't be doing any serious work on this like you can on the iPad's. But to be fair, this is 1/10 the price of my iPad Air 2 and 1/8 the cost of an iPad Mini 4. But I don't believe it's meant to be a direct iPad competitor. Because if it were, it would fail miserably.",3.0

"I like AmazonBasics products, so I was excited to see these batteries. To find out if they were a good value, I looked up data online. Bottom line:-- For flashlights, toys, and steady drain devices, you'll be better off buying Rayovac Alkalines here on Amazon.-- For cameras and photo flashes, Duracell Coppertops will be better.Here's why: Rayovacs cost a little bit more per battery, but they hold more energy than these AmazonBasics batteries. As a result, the final price per amount of power is about the same. You just won't have to change batteries as often.Those Rayovacs work best in steady drain devices, but not so well in cameras or flashes. For those high drain devices, Duracell Coppertops hold up better and end up being cheaper.Battery Ninja tested these AmazonBasics AA's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (mWh), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops.So, the only data to compare here is the toothbrush test. For energy delivered, these AmazonBasics batteries cost about the same as Rayovac batteries but will die sooner. To say that another way, these batteries cost less, but also deliver less power.Both Rayovac and Amazon Basics are better than Energizer batteries, which appear to consistently give less power and still cost more. I guess the money goes to the Energizer Bunny.Duracell Coppertops will last longer in flashlights, toys, and toothbrushes, but cost a little bit more per unit of power (mWh). On the other hand, they hold up better in cameras and similar electronics. They're probably the best all around battery. So, if you don't like changing batteries and a willing to spend a tiny bit more, Coppertops are a good way to go.Finally, the best value battery is interesting: it is the Costco Kirkland Signature. Battery Ninja's results show that and so do the tests from Consumer Reports. You can buy those Costco batteries here on Amazon, but the price is higher than you'd get at the club. Of course, I'm not a Costco member, so it doesn't matter to me... but buying them here on Amazon is not a good value.",3.0
You get what you pay for. Playtime works when it wants to. Went on a long trip and the videos we downloaded had issues playing most of the time. My son is almost 2. He gets bored of it quickly. The pros are the price and it is well protected externally.,3.0

"Sound quality is pretty good if you want it to play background music, but I still prefer Sonos for this purpose. Alexa is useful for controlling the widest range of smart home products, but it's not backed by Google Home's superior search intelligence, so it isn't that great for asking in-depth questions of it. There are comparisons of these products out there, so take a look before making a decision. Since I mostly wanted it for home control, it suits my need.",3.0
Loved the price but I found myself replacing them more quickly in items like the wall clocks and the remote controls. I like having a box of replacement batteries on hand in the house so these are fine for emergencies but I might want to invest in a brand that lasts a bit longer for things like smoke detectors or flashlights.,3.0

"I decided I wanted to ""try"" a tablet for reading books and a little social media instead of using my phone all the time. I researched the Fire 7 and Fire HD 8 and settled on the 7 knowing that it is a low end device. The device is slick and easy to use, and the Alexa integration is really cool. But ""It's a $50 tablet"". At times, the performance is awful slow. I suspect it is updating content, say on twitter or FB. My complaint is when it is doing this, there are no visuals to let you know it is busy. I finally got on Amazon's chat feature, and several hours later, including several power cycles and a complete factory restore, the performance is the same. The reps at Amazon tried their best - and FWIW, I knew there was nothing they could do to speed it up before I contacted them, but I thought I would give it a try. So get this if you want, just be patient. Remember, ""It's a $50 tablet"". If you want better performance, spend more $$.",3.0

"The Echo was so good, I ended up getting the Echo Show as well. At first it was a device that I enjoyed using for various reasons, one being that I could ask Alexa to watch any YouTube videos I wanted to watch. Then one day, I asked Alexa to play a video and she responded by saying,""Google is not supported on Echo Show."" Until YouTube comes back as a skill, the Echo Show probably isn't worth the extra money. I'd say stick with the Echo if you have Amazon Music or Spotify, or the Echo Dot if you only use the echo as part of your smart home.",3.0

"I bought this when it was on sale, and my rewards coupon was expiring so I felt I didn't have much to lose. Overall, this tablet is a good value, but you have to be careful about certain aspects.The tablet is really fast for something in this price range. The screen has pretty good resolution as well. There is no Bluetooth connectivity so keyboards and wireless headphones won't work with it.The app store is the Amazon app store. I side loaded Google Play and am getting my apps from there (YouTube helpful for instructions). The lock screen is an Amazon billboard. The default search is Bing instead of Google. I haven't figured out how to fix that yet. I just use the Google app to search Google. You can load the Chromecast app from Play, but it is hit or miss as to whether it works. It works for YouTube and Flixter, but it doesn't work for any Disney Apps (Watch ESPN, Watch ABC, etc.). You can cast the screen and view things that way, but the resolution is limited to the resolution of the tablet's screen.I think it was a good deal since it was cheap, and I can now watch my Prime Movies on it. Still, it's not the tablet you would expect from an Android device. My satisfaction would improve greatly if Chromecast worked better.",3.0

It's great to swipe to the next page, but when I want to go to settings or something else while reading I find it difficult to open. Instead the page just turns and by the time I finally get to the book settings, I've lost my spot! I downloaded the Facebook app and it's very slow. Maybe it's Amazons way of telling me that's what I get for $50 but come on. Sometimes I like to use the kindle to search the web and that too is slow. I compared it to my older version and there is a noticible difference in speed. I know there are other cool user tools, but for me I mostly use it to read and check Facebook and maybe Pinterest. It's priced well if you want it for kids, it's user friendly and my kids have already figured out all the options. I would recommend it for kids or for people who are technologically not savvy.",3.0

I bought this for travel so I can read as much as I can without bartering and carrying books. It's easy to read but the size doesn't work for me. I have to hold it with two hands. I was hoping I could hold it in one. In retrospect I would get the Amazon Fire instead.,3.0

It's nice but there are too many specific lines to remember to get her to talk to you. Also your family gmail calendar does NOT connect if on iCloud with iPhones so she will not know your families calendar.

This is a good basic tablet bought it for my 4 year old. Only complaint is that it doesn't have one of the most popular games ( despicable me) which my son loves so he still have to use mine for that. Plz update software Amazon!,3.0

"I was really excited for this speaker. Got it all hooked up to my echo and was ready to go. Then I listened to the music. It has no bass. If you want something the has a good range of sound, this isn't it. It is focused on treble only. No low end. I ended up getting the JBL Charge 3. Love it",3.0
"Not what I expected, I am not satisfied with the product",3.0

"If you enjoy music do not buy, you cannot send a Bluetooth signal out to an external speaker. She is not as smart as Siri and answers basic basic questions. I deal with it because I bought the WeMo fixtures for lights and switches and she works fine with those. I would recommend the echo dot if you would like to make her louder or like music loud",3.0
"The Echo is a great product if you have money to burn and tech savvy. Alexa (echo) learns as you talk to it and ask questions. You have to go online and enable different skill sets to allow Alexa to answer more questions. As for operating smart devices this cannot happen wirhout a huge expense. You have to purchase wifi/smart bulbs and switches before she can operate. One smart switch or wifi bulb can cist as much as $30. That's pretty steep to me. On occasion, Alexa will begin talking when no one has called her to respond.",3.0

I originally purchased the Google Home and it was very nice but speaker was not loud enough and it was ugly on my night stand. I swapped to the Echo and it is nice looking at the illumination when responding. The bad part of this device is you have to be very specific when making request and the echo can't hear you when the volume is over 5/10. If I had to redo it I would probably keep the Google home. It was more accurate even on my wake up alarm.,3.0
Did not last as long as expected but good value for price.,3.0

"They're the same size as the batteries they replaced.

Amazon adds are annoying. Lack of compatibility with Google and other apps is annoying. Price is great. Nice to have but it really isn't better than other tablets out there.,3.0
The family loves this because they can communicate to this device and ask it to play their favorite songs or questions or just about anything you can Google.. Even jokes!,3.0
"I would say this is great for kids, but the apps are very limited. There are only a few good free apps in the kindle store. The battery life is very poor. The volume is either loud or it can't be heard. It's hard to find a good middle ground. Overall it's still a good tablet for the price.",3.0

"I purchased this tablet because I saw that it was at an affordable price point for me. With this, it's really not that bad. The only 2 things I've found to be able a little bit annoying is that it's a little awkward to hold/handle when I'm playing my games. The second issue I've found with this type of tablet is that it's made out of plastic & its noisy. The overall performance is quite impressive though. Good price point, with good intentions, just a little cheap feeling & a little big in the hands to hold.",3.0

"For $50 this is a fine tablet, However I bought a 64gb SD card to expand the storage, however i have found that a majority of apps are not able to be saved to the external card , nor can they save data to it (for example Netflix).

I don't normally buy regular batteries, as we go thought them like water in all of our Thomas trains and other toys. I wish I had noticed the difference.",3.0

"The Amazon Echo Tap is a nice & interesting device...but it did not fit my needs. I also have the Amazon Echo and absolutely love it. So what's the difference? A. You have to walk up the the Tap to touch it - this is not as convenient and not as fun as the talking to the Echo from across the room. B. The audio quality not very good - more like a small bluetooth speaker. C. The Tap is fine around the house when it's connected to the home wi-fi, but when you are out of the house it must connect to your cell phone or other wi-fi?? That is not going to work very well.",3.0
"I bought this originally for a younger child to download apps for learning for school and for a few games. It works well, no issues with that, but it is a little harder for him to navigate. From my standpoint, it is smooth and operates the way I expect it.",3.0

OK, I thought, they run short. I ordered a pair size 8.5 and they were just barely long enough.I ordered a second pair size 8.5 and they are visibly half an inch shorter than the first size 8.5 pair.

Adequate performance. I just pulled 16 batteries from four night lights. Half of these were the AmazonBasics AA batteries.

"I have owned a few tablets and currently own an iPad and iPhone. I'm invested in the Amazon ecosystem via Kindle e-readers and Fire TV's. This tablet is incredibly affordable and offers acceptable performance but it's heavily restricted if you do not figure out how to install the Google Play store as the Amazon App Store is missing a huge number of ""every day apps"". It's a great extension for Fire TV's and it's certainly a good choice as a primary tablet for kids or parents who don't have an Apple budget. Personally I still find myself reaching for the iPad.",3.0
"The Fire TV is a good device with a powerful processor and the best Playstation Vue interface. However, it can be frustrating to access the channels you've added as you have to either search for the channel or thumb through them all - one by one.

"Additional info now a couple of months later... We were very disappointed in these batteries as they did not last long at all. We put one in a regular kitchen clock and within 1 week, the time was off by 20 minutes. Put them in a different clock, same results, time was off by 10 minutes within a few days, put them in a battery op shaver, which the other brands most of the time last at least a month, these lasted about a week. Even a small weather station about a week until the time was wrong. Got the 20 pack, not sure if it was a bad batch but we do not recommend these batteries and wont buy them again. Store brands and Rayovac last much longer. Original review below, still stands as easy opening but did edit to say how disappointed we are.Amazon basics AA batteries EASY OPEN packaging is FABULOUS, no cut fingers on sharp plastic packaging and no need for scissors, opened like a dream.... GREAT IDEA!!! Haven't had them long enough to see how long lasting they are.",3.0

"I ordered this online on black Friday, I live about 30 miles from nearest store and I saw the special on their website, so why not I thought. Came in yesterday. Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this. It's actually for my son and even though teens are often smarter than we adults when it comes to gadgets, LOL, I don't think he will like this either. So I'm returning this; hopefully can find an Android tablet I like (and affordable) at Best Buy.",3.0

"So I've seen this at the mall and the TV ads and thought hmmm that sounds good. Note mine does not sound as good as the units I've heard play music at the stores. I don't know why and there does not seem to be any adjustments you can make to that. All you can do is say volume up, volume down or say volume lever 1-10.At no time was I told that you needed to use your smart phone and or table to down load the Alexa App and then run everything through that. Most of the time I say Alexa who is Morris Knight. ""I don't know"" Alexa was Morris Knight a VJ on MTV. ""I don't know"". Alexa can you tell me who was a VJ on MTV ""I don't know"". So I get ""I don't know"" more often then an get and answer. If I do get an answer Alexa will often give me an answer to a for a different person the person I asked about.If you have a Amazon Fire Stick. Don't ask Alexa about a ""MOVIE"" or is Joan Collins in the movie The Virgin Queen. Because for me anytime I use the word ""MOVIE"" she will turn on my Fire Stick. So if you are watching something else you are no longer watching it. She can turn on the Amazon Fire Stick but she can't put your TV back to what you were watching before.The Echo device will often tell you to go to the Alexa App. So I'm really not sure what the Echo Device does. Everything is run through the Alexa App so just get your table out and use Alexa that way?I'm just not very happy with this purchase. I went to the Mall and the person said ""Bring in your Tablet and I can see what is going on"". So see it's driven by that tablet and the app right?",3.0

But this particular version doesn't have the same pleasing page color as my 5 year old Kindle, which is strange. But I really needed the light to actually be able to read when I usually want to read. So when the light is on it's pretty nice.The interface is rather slow, which is to be expected given it's not a traditional LCD screen (it's literally a printing press), but I wish the interface had better ways to organize and change the order of books. The other problem I had was that the first one I received had a large hole in the upper layer of the screen (where the light diffuses through) so it had this glowing hole that reminded me of a giant stuck pixel. Also there were a few random stuck black spots. The next one did not have these problems. Amazon will replace it for you if it does.",3.0
I'm not sure these are lasting as long as more well-known brands. Maybe I just got a bad batch. Not sure.,3.0
"Thought this would be perfect for my two children. The case, warranty and pass to download unlimited apps seemed great. However, the pad is sometimes unresponsive and inaccurate-which can be frustrating for children. The case is a little too bulky. And it can be confusing for children who want to push an icon to play but it instead downloads. There is a definite learning curve that they will overcome in time but it could be more user friendly for younger users.",3.0
Very easy to setup up and can be used to automate home using smart skills. I use to control hue lighting and nest products. Only complaint is she is not as smart as they say. Constant updates are making her better but lacking a lot of information when asked. Emails are sent with update info. 90 percent on voice commands. Wish it came with optional remote for when you are out of range of voice,3.0
For a five year old this worked fine but was a bit slow loading games. But 5 year olds these days want it immediately. Like the kid friendly free books and games. It worked well with downloaded Disney movies and Netflix. May have to get one for 2 year old suster they both live it,3.0

I bought the Amazon Fire thinking it was all that and it is as long as I am home with a strong wifi. It does not pick up wifi good the connection is very weak when I try to connect elsewhere like I have to be right near the box or it doesn't pick up. But I find that with my camera also an Amazon product. Ok so that may be the problem.,3.0

I ordered my fire HD like a week before Christmas. The day I received it I ordered a case for it on amazon and before I even got the case it fell fro! About 2 ft off the floor on carpet and the screen cracked. I called BestBuy and I was told that I had. Free 6 months protection on it so I made an appointment with geek squad my husband called out of work to take me and when we go they tell me that I don't have any protrvtion plan and that there isn't anything they can do for me. Honestly it got to me because I you can't do anything about it its fine just tell me. But don't male me gp allthe way there and waste my time. Ended up buying a better and bigger tablet.

"We've tried several of these little streamer boxes - Fire TV, Roku3, Apple TV (not the newest one). I think the Roku is my favorite. This one is competent, if you have Amazon Prime you'll miss it on the Apple TV. But the voice command mode - the one distinguishing feature of the Fire - is not useful. It only searches Amazon content and while Amazon has a lot of stuff we watch more on Netflix, HBO, Showtime, Hulu, etc. So, not so useful. I would get the Roku. The remote with headphones is a great feature.",3.0
"Tablet is great. I am trying to get my daughter use to the kindle. We started her at 10 months on an Ipad and thought it would be easier to get one her own tablet now that she is almost 2. Not so, she is struggling to navigate in the kindle. I am not able to transfer her games and movies.",3.0

"I had to spend a lot of time figuring out how to allow apps from the Google Play store to be installed. Without that capability this tablet isn't very good. Amazon just doesn't have enough apps available. I did a fare amount of research on the internet to find the process for installing the google play store. I also notice that this isn't a ""snappy"" and ""fast"" device but I wouldn't expect it to be for $50. For the right situation this is a great buy.",3.0

It's a good tablet for the price considering it was only $50. Not the best quality but suitable for my kids to enjoy,3.0
There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.,3.0

My wife has one and hers has been great for her this entire time.",3.0

"I bought one of these on Black Friday on impulse since it was $34.99 and I had a $5 certificate to use. I have a third generation iPad and am quite accustomed to using it and the App Store.Pros: OS is Android based and not too hard to pick up compared to Apple. I did find versions of a lot of favorite apps and games to download. It can take up to 128GB microSD card for expanding storage (only 8 GB built in). I got a 64 GB class 10 card at Costco for $20.Cons: screen resolution is only 1024 x 768, but I can't say it's super noticeable in normal use. Not all apps available even if an Android version exists. Much more useful if you have Amazon Prime as it ties directly to an Amazon.com account, and In fact you have to register the device before you can do much of anything on it. Battery life is not impressive either, with standby time in particular not great.For the price, it's a handy spare internet connected device. I'm not one to buy Kindle books, but the ones I do have are certainly easy to access and read.",3.0
It's okay for a beginner tablet to me. Not enough apps for purchase. I like the play store better.,3.0
The battery on this device cannot handle true apps outside of the Amazon ecosystem. Youtube and Twitch would drain the battery in under an hour. But if used as intended it would be great for books and email.,3.0
"It is too narrow, if watching a vid or utube, some of the pic is cut off. Can't erase the entire history. It keeps it and then recommends still based on your history, even tho you have cleared it.

It was Perfect and they discontinued it for this line. It is a fingerprint magnet! Have to clean it daily.",3.0

I do like the Fire Tablet - but I feel that if it is going to have a camera it should have been a better camera. The internet works but I find it takes a while to load.

Just regular AA batteries at a decent price.,3.0
I bought this tablet to use with my 3 year old autistic son. I tried 3 different tablets and all 3 were defective. It would turn off by itself during a video. We were using It for his therapy sessions and this was very inconvient. Switched to a 7 and have had no trouble since.,3.0
Even though the price of the tablet matters the display and resolution should have been much better. Feels like working in the tablet without the charger connected. Amazon disappointed me with this product. Minor issues in installing the apps which are available in iOS too.,3.0

This tablet is showing it's age. I bought one for my 10 year old back when he was 7 and it was cool then. Picked up two on sale for my 4 and 5 year old so they can leave my phone alone and they like it. However it's slow when downloading apps and I constantly have to plug in my pin. Battery life isn't that great either especially when they stream movies so i still have to give up my phone . Overall still a decent product hood picture and they like it.,3.0

Overall a good buy for the price but if you are expecting the quality that went into previous versions look elsewhere.",3.0
I didn't do any in depth research on this particular tablet. The price and speed were good for what I wanted it for. My only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so I can see my personal home screen picture.,3.0
i mean if you want just a tablet to read some books and browse internet thats fine.,3.0
I would say that it is not for kids is because my kids have been downloading game after game even with a 64 gig sd card the main operating system only allows about 2 gigs of games that cannot be transferred to the data card so storage is very limited,3.0
Does not pick up WiFi very well; apps take longer to download...However regular software apps work great!,3.0
"I would like to rate this 3 and half stars - while the adapter itself works just fine, I think it is underhanded of Amazon to make you pay extra for it. Maybe I am not technologically up-to-date, but it seems to me that most people charge things at a wall socket not with a computer USB port. I think that I read that charging with USB takes longer as well. Just like an airline charging you for taking your bags on the plane, now Amazon is charging you for things you need to make the Kindle work - pretty soon you'll have to pay for the cord, guides and updates. Not very good customer service :(",3.0
"The product has a $90 price tag and the 90 warranty is too short. My tablet died within a month. I took it to Best Buy where they said they don't handle the warranty, went to Amazon web site where they said go to the store where I bought the device. After much digging around Amazon web site I found out who would help me. I gave it a one star and Amazon helped me quick. We were able to get it going again, a manual would help.

"I have had every version of the Kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a Kindle Fire. I replaced the first one I had in 2014 and it was everything I wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat. So...I got this one. First of all I miss Swype. WHY get rid of it? Secondly I cannot put two of my favorite apps (which work on my old one) to work on this but lastly and most importantly: every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code ""shimmering"" in the background and only turning it off and/or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life AND it turns itself off. It seems to happen when I close a program and move to a new one. Aggravating and not what I expect from a product with which I have been happy in the past.",3.0
"Fire worked fine and was simple to set up. I must add, however, that the overview menu should have more than a few on-line locations (Apps) like Netflix and YouTube. It should work as a main menu whose apps include things like liveTV, DiscPlayer, and even phonograph. Instead, it is pretty much all-Amazon. At least, if it was easy to access, it was Amazon. Aliza was not all that helpful either for non-Amazon material, certainly not for TV shows that are not in the Amazon library. I think it is a mistake to make me change source to access almost anything but Amazon. I was spoiled by my previous (Old Sony) BluRay Disc Player that did indeed act like a central menu for everything -- including Amazon. I may be showing my age and ignorance here, but I bet I have lots of company. I say KISS for usage, even if it means a more complicated install.",3.0
You get what you pay for. It's $50 and that's about the quality you get. Overall works great but slow and crashes occasionally. Not the best battery.,3.0
"These are okay. They aren't as long-lasting as name brands so in the end, I'm probably not saving money using these.

Much harder to work than an android. None of the wallpaper apps I downloaded from the kindle store work on the device. many of the other apps look cheap on the display. other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper $49 tablet. They make it look like an android tablet but it is not. no google play. Everything is just harder to work than on a regular android BUT for a tablet under $100 it exceeds expectations. It is more responsive than other models of fire,3.0
The tablet is great for reading. It does not allow you to download many of the games my child enjoys which are usually available on other tablets.,3.0

I returned it because I wanted better sound...opted for a bose soundlink. Decent speaker with nice amazon prime/Alexa features...just not the sound I was looking for.,3.0

"This tablet is great for a first time tablet owner, just smaller than my current one.",3.0
"I really wanted to give this device a chance but I did end up returning it. It's a HUGE upgrade though over the cheaper 7"" version. Honestly I don't think anyone should purchase that. If your budget can handle getting this version and you are heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem (i.e. Prime member) this will make a great tablet. I think it is intended more for kids though than adults. Having iPads in the house we tried this with our toddler as a cheaper tablet for her but the interface and quirks of the Amazon OS just were not worth the hassle. Will end up seeking out a used iPad Mini 2 instead of this.",3.0

"I bought this tablet to connect to my hdtv. After not being able to get it to connect, I called Amazon customer care who informed me that this model doesn't connect to the tv, but the previous model (4th generation) does and that I should purchase the Amazon fire stick.

"Maybe I didn't give it enough time. I had it a few weeks before I returned it. I just didn't feel the love. I see a lot of potential. I was wanting to control some of my WIFI connected devices like my thermostat, TV, and some lighting. but it took a lot of programming to get it there. So maybe after they do the heavy programming for outside devices then I'll try it again.",3.0
Decent somewhat slow. Netflix freezes up at times.,3.0

"I enjoy the Alexa for music using Pandora. Unfortunately, I can not listen to music that is on my iPhone. I've done all the things that it told me to do to download music to the Alexa app but it still does not recognize the songs. Also, it seems that the Alexa only uses Bing for looking up information from the internet and not google. So, she's very limited in providing information when asked a question. Maybe, it's not that compatible with apple products and best used with families who have windows based products.",3.0
"I got 2 of this for kids 5 and 3 it is a pretty good tablet, easy to navigate for the children but (and this is on me for not researching) but kid content is only free for a year, after that you gotta pay a monthly fee which is cheaper if you are a prime member, but still...Now reason why I'm about to return them! You CANNOT get YouTube kids at all! No google apps. You can get some YouTube kids clones on the adult profile and add them to the kid's profile but they stink. They're full of commercials.So I wasn't expecting this tablet to be like an iPad but this is a deal breaker for me.",3.0

When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't,3.0

"We switched from an older model tablet to this simplified Kindle Fire. For the price, it is a decent reader, which is primarily what we were seeking, but it has its limitations.The primary user in the house used it to read before bed. He feels the lowest brightness setting is still too bright, so he defaults his books/documents to black screen. However, words in italics default to the screen background, which means they are black. Doh!He also doesn't like the persistence of the Washington Post popping up on his Home Screen. He finds it a bit annoying. However, he doesn't mind the ads and suggested content from Amazon at all. it is just the Washington Post that he doesn't like.Beyond those minor things, it is an inexpensive and feature rich ereader. Being Amazon Prime customers, we share content between our accounts with ease now that we both are on Kindle platform.",3.0
Very slow.My 73 year old mother loves it.I would recommend this to a elder or a young child.,3.0

"I bought 2 and am returning them both. Both had lighting issues. On the first one, one half of the screen had a white/blue tint and the other half was more of a yellow tint. When i flipped the device upside down to rotate to use with my other hand, half of the screen went much darker than the other. I returned it because I had read there were some that had lighting issues and bought another one. My second one was worse. You could see little half moons going down one side. That one also had a much yellower tint overall than the first one.I found it not easy to hold unless it was in the charging case. It was too slippery and, weird to say, small for me. I'm a female with average sized hands.I think what I really did love was the charging case and the size for transport purposes. Maybe when they make a few tweaks and lower the price I might try again.",3.0

This is my 3rd Kindle. I have continued to move up on the screen size and this one is so easy to see and read. I do however sometimes have a problem with it when I am online. It can take forever to load up a site and move from page to page so that can be annoying. I have extremely fast internet so that is not the problem and when I check strength of wifi connection it always says excellent so not sure why it takes so long. Do not have that problem on my other 2.,3.0
"I mainly use this tablet to read my kindle books on but it also handles playing music and watching videos fine. Great for social media as well. A perfect first tablet for someone who has yet to experience a tablet or smart mobile technology. Definitely buy a decent sized micro SD card when you get it though, as the real space you receive after purchase is more like 4 GB because the OS takes so much space on the device.",3.0

Silk is painfully slow and doesn't work on many websites. Had to install Mozilla to use bestbuy.com ironically. I can't put in orders with Silk (the default Fire browser). If using Silk make sure to disable the caching to Amazons servers. With caching on the browser is almost unusable.Ads are really annoying (only come on when you first turn it on) but I don't even really notice what they are. Usually things I'd never purchase like makeup (I'm a guy) or other junk. These make decent devices for the kids for playing games on too. This is not a quality device like a Galaxy Tab but for the price its good enough because you know they're going to break it at some point.,3.0

"I have an older Fire HD 7 and had started reading a lot more periodicals on it (okay, I admit it, comic books). So when the news about the Fire HD 8 7th generation went out, I put in a pre-order and eagerly anticipated its arrival so I could have just a slightly larger screen and better performance.The Fire HD 8 delivered on those two fronts. It's noticeably snappier than my HD 7, and the screen is larger. No arguing those points.My Fire HD 8 arrived charged to 73%, so I hooked it up to the included charger and set it to download some of the aforementioned periodicals. I checked on it two hours later and noticed that it had managed a measly 4% increase in battery charge in that time. Starting at 73%, I would have expected it to at least be in the mid to high 80s after two hours.After experimenting a bit, I found that the only way I could get a sort of decent charging speed was to turn the Fire HD off altogether and let it charge with absolutely nothing else running. I am now able to charge at a rate of about 1% every 10 to 15 minutes, an improvement over 1% per half hour, but it means having to fully turn off the Fire HD before I plug it in and then restart it when I want to use it again. The Fire HD 8 will maintain an even charge level while it is plugged in and in use, but don't expect it to replenish the battery in that state.Aside from that, the Fire HD 8 seems a decent tablet for a $100 price point. Just don't expect it to fully charge overnight if you deplete it the day before.",3.0

If it weren't for those two complaint, I'd give this tablet 4 stars.",3.0
This tablet is okay however the screen is too small and the WiFi does not work well. The WiFi turns off and I have to manually reset it over and over. The camera is nice however the resolution is not sharp enough for my needs. Does not make sense why there is not a version without cameras with a bigger screen size.,3.0

"I purchased the new Kindle Tablet not really knowing what to expect..I didn't read any reviews before hand, nor did I try the one in store. After getting home, charging, and applying updates I noticed there are numerous bright/stuck pixels at least 8. It's only noticeable on dark screens. I understand the devices limitations verses price but you would expect to at least have a functional screen with maybe 1 pixel issue at most.As I mentioned above when you plug it in and turn it on it immediately starts an update, that process took a good thirty minutes to complete. Upon first boot I went to register with my Amazon account but it returned some funky error message, I tried again and it said the device was already registered, so I was unable to complete the setup/walk through. I'm a very technical user so this wasn't too big of an issue, but I could see where it could be for someone that isn't savvy with computers/tablets.All that said in use, it runs decently, and def better then you would expect a Tablet at this price point to run. It's not a power house per-se but for what it's built for, consumption device, it does everything from play movies, music and casual games with out a hitch. The UI is realitivley snappy as well.Pros:- Price- IPS Screen viewable at most angles- Works well with the Amazon eco systemCons:- Mono sound (1 speaker poorly placed on back of unit)- Stuck Pixels out of the box- Low Resolution- Device registration issuesIn closing I would recommend to friends as long as they understand it's limitations.",3.0
"It's a nice looking cover, will keep the Fire clean, but not particularly safe in a fall. (I have the black one. It is very professional looking.) No padding whatsoever. It does wake the Fire up when opened (and shut down when closed) but that has never been important to me. My problem with all of the cases is that you have to hold the cover out in order to keep the camera clear and it makes clicking the shutter a little awkward. I'd like to see an opening on the front cover that matches up to the opening on the back so you can have it folded in half and still be able to view the subject.",3.0

This thing is ok. Next time we get electronics it will be Amason,3.0
I'll give it 3 starts because it's a decent tablet. But if the screen messes up when I'm trying to use it i can't imagine how my granddaughter feels.,3.0
Ok for a younger teen. Mediocre product. Still worth the sale price.,3.0
Good: but don't seem to last as long as major brands,3.0
Just wish I could remove most of the Amazon apps other then that it's good for the kids.,3.0
"I got this to work with my Arlo Pro camera, and it works well. I am able to have my camera for driveway and front door come up on command. I hate that I cannot get my Samsung TV to come on with a verbal request. I guess I will have to buy the plug for it. This was very easy to set up. Downloaded the app, and plugged it in, viola it walks you through the setup.",3.0
I returned this item because I couldn‚Äôt get a keyboard with a case to go with it.,3.0
"I thought there would be a bigger step up from the fire stick. Honestly, if you want to save money, just go with the fire stick.",3.0
first tBlet that i got was defective and returened and got anothers one because when i powered on screen was totally white,3.0
Pretty slow if you're trying to use it as a full-time tablet. Good as an eReader and sometimes game and Internet usage.,3.0
"Alexa is a great tool. It's fun to use, but the DOT has just as much functionality and seems to hear my voice better. The speaker on the Echo is better, but when the volume us up high, it can't hear me at all. The DOT can connect to an external speaker via bluetooth or 3.5mm, and it's a third of the price",3.0
"Works well. But does not offer access to the apple or android App Store. Without the apps that I need, this tablet is not as useful.",3.0
"Bought two of these tablets for my stepson and mother-in-law for Christmas. Not bad items for the price. Basic tablets,basic features, nothing special about them. They use them for connecting to the internet, playing games and watching movies. This tablet does this well on wi-fi. I expect them to perform well for the next couple of months.",3.0
"I bought this to replace an older kindle that broke. It has more features, like front/ rear facing camera and better resolution screen. I feel like it doesn't work as well though. The screen doesn't always respond. The Internet freezes a lot. The colors seem to be a little off. All in all, still a decent piece for the price.",3.0
"can't beat the price I bought this at from Best Buy. It has held up well inside the beefy case we bought for it, and the screen is nice and sharp. However, the unit did randomly shut off and refuses to power back up without ever coming into contact with water or any drops. I am glad that the replacement plan was very affordable.",3.0
"If you aren't tech savvy, know someone who is to be able to get Alexa to respond. Amazon was kind enough to email me to offer support; I'm afraid the first question will be, ""Is it plugged in?"" I'm not tech savvy, but I also have some sense.",3.0
I like the size of this tablet. I have small hands and it fits. Needs to have a cover a little slippery. Easier to handle than my iPad,3.0
"It is ok for the average user. But it os not good enough for Kodi. The interface is ok, but a little too busy for me. I did not like the fact that I could not use my universal Harmony remote with it. Jodi also takes almost an hour to set up and it buffers way more than on the Shield.",3.0
They don't seem to last long,3.0
"I liked the sound quality coming out of the Echo. I ended up returning this for an Echo Dot. The Dot is 1/3rd of the price and for my townhouse, I don't need a high powered speaker. Alexa is great to use, no matter what Echo device you have.",3.0
"Love the product, not happy that there have been two sales on it at Best Buy. One 18 days after purchase $50 off, today 23 days after purchase online $80 off. They won't help me, after 15 days I was told!",3.0
I recently bought my fourth Kindle. I bought it because it is familiar and while there are improvements the keyboard is still difficult and not accurate. I also do not like the auto correct especially when writing a document. Browsing is quite good but I am a AOL user and Kindle makes it difficult to use. I definitely would like to see some improvement with making it easier to print.,3.0
Don't know if it's my camera or the batteries but they seem to run down pretty quickly,3.0
Great case.. took awhile to get to my house but after several delays it finally got there.,3.0
great for toddlers. I recommend anyone to purchase a protective case,3.0

"Wondering why I spent $150 for the Echo when I could have purchased the Dot for $40 and does everything the Echo does...and more! With the Dot you can stream music to Bluetooth speakers, which can't be done with the Echo.",3.0
"Wry basic, but I guess, it's ok for the price. Bought for a 6 year old.",3.0
There are some privacy concerns as recently reported in the news and the device is limited without a paid subscription to Amazon Music.,3.0
My Echo hasn't updated to the latest version that allows for hands-free operation. I'm not sure what the problem is.,3.0
Works for what we needed.,3.0
"I purchased 2 others for my 5 & 6yr-olds, and my 3yr-old niece enjoyed playing theirs so much I then bought this one for her. The included 1yr subscription to free-time is awsome for the kids! Parental controls are great, and included apps are helpful.The lower rating is because the charging port was extremely loose, as the cord falls out ALL the time! Very Frustrating!",3.0
paid 39.00 on sale. bought two and 1 week later one will not connect to wifi will have to return.,3.0
Didn't last as long as I would have liked,3.0
I am unable to connect with iPad Pro which limits one of the primary reasons for the purchase. I will appreciated recommendations to connect the devices.,3.0
You have to purchase to many accessories for it to work.,3.0
Price was right. Bought it mostly to be able to watch movies but the quality of the movies is not as good as I had hoped which is the main reason behind my average rating.,3.0
My 4yr old was able to operate it flawlessly. The included case works its magic to keep the tablet from any accidental screen cracks.,3.0
"Decent performance but sometime do lag a bit, screen resolution is a bit low for someone coming from a Galaxy S6 and Note 7. But for $33 (got on a sale) you can't expect top end product. Installed Google Play Store without needing root, so I can share my normal adroid app even though this is running fire OS",3.0
"I bought this for my daughter. It was bundled with a solid bumper case and has a kid mode interface. She insisted on using her brother's iPad constantly. Not to say there is anything wrong with this product, it just wasn't for her.",3.0
"I wasn't aware of all the apps that needed a premium membership for playing music. That was a disappointment, but other than that I enjoy the product.",3.0
My son truly loves his Kindle. He uses it everyday.,3.0
I dont like the kindle because u cant connect it chromecast!,3.0
Kindle fire is good because of the other things you can do besides just reading books. But it is slow and hard to read in sun.,3.0
"Nice built tablet. You need to note that it has Amazon Store, and no Google Play Store.",3.0
I gave this as a gift and so I heard it has been working very well,3.0
I bought a kindle fire. It serves my purpose of reading pdf files.,3.0
Kindle fire is slow but love the fact my child is protected from some internet content,3.0
Not sure about these yet. The question is whether the battery last long enough for the price that i paid for them. Will update later when i find out.,3.0
I thought Alexa was like your smart phone Siri but it's not. It's very limited to what you can ask and you must download some of the Apps in within the Alexa app to work and ask question. Not what I though it was.,3.0
Just an average Alexa option. Does show a few things on screen but still limited.,3.0
I have to unplug it and wait 30 seconds every time,3.0
I have a simple electronic keypad I use these batteries in. With the name brand I would go about 2 months. With the amazon brand i go 2 weeks. Not sure I am sold on this being an equivalent battery just yet.,3.0
"Kids will love this tablet, has a camera and kids can make movies with it. Wonderful for a child with a good imagination",3.0
"Fun for the first few days, but we hardly use it now after figuring out it can't answer many of our queries.",3.0
"i got this tablet for traveling. Just games, reading, stuff like that so I didn't need anything fancy. It works but it lags on games and the battery life is horrible.",3.0
"It's fine, but not necessary. Had I known that I could charge my Kindle with my tablet and/or phone charging cord I would not have bought it.",3.0
Medium durability. Gonna buy Duracell in future. Do you have great quality rechargeables,3.0
"Not so great unless you want to spending alot of money on amazon for everything, unable to download any google are android apps.",3.0
"The idea is right but after few weeks, needs restarting else it doesn't respond properly. Compatible devices pairs properly. I used lifx bulbs but it couldn't control them with voice says no device found. Hopefully they will release a software update soon.",3.0
the app for that does not work well i haven't used it that much just for news,3.0
I did read about the game prior to buying it but so far the game is only half decent. Too much of the same thing.,3.0
The layout of the tablet is good. Internet is terrible.,3.0
good product but very hard to customize like real androids. Can not install firefox or other SW that Amazon deems a competition...too bad,3.0
It's good but to get more connection and less buffing get the one with the Internet cable,3.0
Sometime it just stays in sleep mode and you have to restart it,3.0
"Nothing really great about it. It's basically a box to watch Amazon on demand. I have a smart tv, so to me this useless.",3.0
Overall I wasn't too impressed with his tablet. Actually returned it for an iPad mini bc my kid like it better and it was easier to use.,3.0
This is OK purchased as battery does not last long with cost paid.,3.0
Brought this for my 8 yr old son. He cannot put it down. Would recommend this product.,3.0
Good unit. But i have to reconnect the wifi often when using netflix,3.0
"This is a competent tablet at a bargain price. Unfortunately it is crippled by a useless operating system. Amazon's take on Android essentially removes all functionality that makes Android great, to force you to use their services and apps INSTEAD of Google's.If you're a tinkerer or don't mind doing some software hacking, this is a pretty easy fix. You can hack Google's apps and services back into it, resulting in an amazing, and amazingly cheap Android tablet.Unless you're willing to do, or hire someone to do, those software modifications, you'll probably be disappointed. If you are, it'll be the best cheap tablet you'll ever own.It looks like it might be great for kids, even in its stock state. I don't have kids, so I could not test that. But I added a star for that possibility.Unmodified: 2 starsModified: 5 stars",3.0
"This product is what you pay for. Got it on black Friday at less than 40 dollars. It uses are basic and good for my kids. If you need a babysitter, it comes into play for an hour. Battery life is pretty good",3.0
Great for a first tablet. Needed something larger than my phone and it comes in handy when the grandkids visit.,3.0
"As a low priced 8"" tablet, it has a good display, good speed, and reasonable battery life.I am a bit peeved by the rather intrusive adds that Amazon pushes onto it.I am also unhappy that I cannot load all the apps I am used to using on my Android phone. Overall, I wish I had spent more for a real Android device rather than having this with the Amazon limited version of Android.",3.0
Duracell batteries last longer than these.,3.0
For the price is good. But you have a lot of offers from Amazon on your main screen without even asking for it. Does not accept googlecast. The case for the tablet is too expensive. Well for basics it works fine,3.0
Bought it as a toy for my daughter to play games and watch videos.,3.0
I brought these as christmas presents for my kids and so far no complaints.,3.0
Any one who doesn't want to spend too much money and get a tablet for kids it is perfect for them.,3.0
good price and they are as good as the major brands,3.0
"After reading how fast this unit was, I was highly disappointed. My Roku 3 leaves the Amazon Fire Tv in the dust. It takes forever to load up, then freezes several times while being used.",3.0
Bought these batteries for my Christmas gifts the month of (december) only lasted like 2months toys now need replacement batteries . I also used some for my doorbell and just now needs replacement batteries. Tv Remote control is still working but these batteries don't last very long...,3.0
Just my . opinion but i like the Apple tv better. Just easier to use,3.0
Decent little tablet at the price won't break the budget if broken.,3.0
It was great product. the price which I got it was great.,3.0
"Alexa is OK for basic weather and turning on/off a light you have linked on your network. She still has some issues understanding basic commands and i would love to see skills from major airlines that allow you to check flights before you drive to the airport. The music sound quality is good and you have to be an Amazon Prime member to really see value there. Hopefully, in a year it will turn out to be a good investment.",3.0
This tablet is sufficient for secondary use. At times searches are slow and memory is limited.,3.0
Ours did not last nearly as long as energizer or Duracell in our sons toys. No real data to prove this other than we went through batteries like they were candy until I restocked with energizer.,3.0
"I recently bought these to use in my Streamlight Microstream flashlight. I've carried one every day for the past 4 years and I love them. I say them because I'm on my 6th one maybe. It's my fault, really. I lose them very easily for some reason. Anyway, these batteries are average at best. I generally get copper tops or energizers and was looking for an economical equivalent. This isn't it. I find myself replacing the battery in my flashlight more often than I used to. These batteries might be ok for your tv remote or battery powered clock but I'd pass if you need them for anything you rely on.",3.0
Best at its price. Just bought it because its less when compared ot other leading tablets. good for Skype.,3.0
"It works well, it's the same as using the firestick to me just cost more.",3.0
"I bought the 8"" version on impulse because of an excellent offer on Black Friday. As an Amazon product, it offers Amazon apps. While you can get Google Play apps, it requires some hoops. I just discovered I can't save movies from Netflix because that only applies to the HDX version. So this product has limits. But used as a Kindle reader, or to get email via wifi, or other uses (wifi only) while traveling where you wouldn't want to take an expensive device, it is a good choice.",3.0
"They didn't last very long in my cheap camera. With them not being lithium I didn't expect them to last forever, but I should of gotten more then a days use out of them. In my Xbox controller they lasted an adequate amount of time. So all in all these definitely aren't for heavy use and the price point reflects that.",3.0
"This tablet is good to browse the web, check emails, watch youtube videos,... The screen is small but still bigger than any smartphone.It's a bit slow but it's a good bang for the buck.Big drawback: no access to google play and no support for chromecast if you want to cast to your TV.",3.0
they have to b changed alot but it good for remotes or clocks low power products,3.0
"Meh, they work, wud gladly pay more for USA made tho!",3.0
"I purchased this as a gift for my daughter and she loves it. Easy to read and stores all of her books. My only complaint is that it feels slow and sluggish when transitioning from one screen tk the next. Even turning the page feels slow. Not sure if it has a setting to change this but its a noticeable difference between this device and the kindle fire both with out of the bix settings. My daughter doesn't mind it and prefers the screen on the paperwhite for reading. Battery life is fantastic, its so good you can go on a weekend trip and leave the charger at home.",3.0
"Good price. When new, they tested on the low end of good with my voltmeter. I'll add to my post after I've had a chance to test battery life.",3.0
Nice tab for young kids getting use to using Tabs. Fully functional and fairly easy to use.,3.0
I purchased this tablet for my sister as a Christmas present.,3.0
Wish it was easier to understand set up so children don't accidently charge to my account.,3.0
"It's a cheap tablet that you can just give to your kids or whatever. The ads are annoying but then again you can't expect too much with the price point. However, I would not recommend using this for any kind of work at all because it's very slow and finicky at times but if you're tired of giving your kids your phone/tablet this is the product for you. Just make sure you take off your payment info, maybe even make their own personal amazon account.",3.0
"I purchased this for my mother to use primarily to check Facebook and watch Netflix. I was a little bit disappointed to find out that there was not a Vudu app available. I hope that one is in the development stages. I knew that this was not a full out tablet when I bought it, but had hoped that since it was based on Android, it would have the major Android apps.",3.0
Tablet was reasonably priced. Would say it's a starter tablet for kids. Kind of slow on response but the kids enjoy it.,3.0
They last less than your average alkaline batteries.,3.0
do not seem to last as long as other batteries,3.0
Good for kids just wanting to play games or watch movies. Even when purchasing extra gb storage cards.,3.0

I feel like it plays the same playlist every time.,3.0
"I wouldn't buy again, had trouble w/shutting off all the time, we would have it reset back to the factory reset status and it would lock up and freeze, actually replaced with second thinking that was just a bad one however sad to report same problems. Not a favorite purchase.",3.0
"These are okay. I use them mostly in my Xbox controller, they runout pretty quick. They are fine but I am looking into getting a rechargeable battery pack for it because I hate having my controller die mid game.",3.0

I use this tablet for my daughter and I could only download YouTube Kids. Wished I would have purchased the one with more storage.,3.0
they seem to have a very short life span. do not think i would buy again.,3.0

I did not use this product I gave it as a present.,3.0
"Too many zippers IMO. Good quality, but the zippers frequently get caught making it slightly annoying to open.",3.0
I purchased this to download books for school. Screen too small and OS was not to my liking,3.0

The juice in these batteries aren't long term.,3.0
"If you're looking for something to keep your laptop cool, this will do the trick. Although only bad things are, it isn't comfortable sitting on your lap as the metal just isn't awesome. The rivets where you rest your hands are welded things and they're uncomfortable as they dig into your hands when trying to type or even resting your hands. Wouldn't recommend..",3.0
"Works great until....... I had forgotten that Amazon fire did not come with Google Playstore. I looked up how to add Playstore to the 7"" Fire. There are many videos on YouTube that showed how to add Playstore to the fire. All seemed to add it OK but the loss performance of the Fire was noticeable. There were several apps that failed to work at all or lost features. One example was Lifetime. It was slow to load and failed to bring up Chromecast. One reason I hoped for this app would work was my Samsung and Vizio SMART TV's don't offer this app. I found a old tablet I had forgotten I had. I loaded Lifetime and works perfect. I guess what it boils down to, it you are after apps on the Playstore, get a non Amazon tablet. It is just easier to use, apps should work and you don't have to fool around trying to adapt Playstore. If Playstore isn't critical, then I'm sure this a a great little table.",3.0
Great price.... It's good for games play and great tablet with this price,3.0

"This tablet is great for books, audible books, music and all things Amazon. The included browser (Silk) is not the best. I purchased expanded memory (64GB SD card) for about $30 more and a cover for about $20. The biggest issue I have with this unit is that it is slow (when compared to an iPad) and it tends to freeze every so often. For about 2.5x more money, consider an iPad instead.",3.0
"I purchased this for our goddaughter and while the price is amazing, and the tablet is acceptable for low overhead use, I set up the same tablet for my daughter and it is too slow for my use.",3.0

My 4 yo grandnephew and 3 yo daughter love them! The tablet does freeze but that's what happens sometimes! They love them!,3.0
Very limited. Have activate skills.. a little bit of a pain. Otherwise fun to mess with her. Will learn as we go. Have used go control lights and other. Works ok.,3.0
I feel like we change the batteries more often with these.,3.0
This item is taking forever to charge and not holding the charge. We may have to return. I assume it is this unit and not all.,3.0
Totally not convinced these are as good as name brands because I have had to replace several batteries way too soon.,3.0
Just ok,3.0
"Works okay for what we paid. Not super speedy, quality is a little grainy as well",3.0
"I was not a fan of the Amazon type operating system that is on the tablet. Ended up taking it back because it was not what I wanted, not as easy and supportive of games and apps as an Android tablet.",3.0
"Great tablet for the price! I bought two of these for my Grandkids to use, as they are always using ours! The only thing that I really don't like about them is that they have so many pop in commercials for grown ups and it makes everything stop. Hard for my little three year old to get this! I wish it were a little more kid friendly as far as ease of use and getting to where you want to be. For the price, I guess we will just deal with it! :)",3.0
Needs to be more simpler. parental contorl still need to be better,3.0
"For the price, you can't really go wrong. But they don'5 last long.The only problem is that the battery life is not long at all. If you are using these in a TV Remote (or similar remotes) they will last 3-4 months.If you use these in a flashlight or power toothbrush (or similar items), they only last about a month.It seems that these don't last long in items that you need to use daily for longer periods of time. But, if you are using these for a TV/STB Remote or a holiday decoration that plays music, they will last much longer (approx 3-4 months).",3.0
"Price is low, but OS is lacking unlike other brands it doesnt come with a decent charger. To refill battery you have to charge it overnight.",3.0
Sad that I had to replace my original Kindle due to inability to recharge the unit. Now with this model the charge plug is a pain to use. Kindle please work on your designs.,3.0

"I wouldn't buy it again...the software doesn't seem as well integrated with the hardware on this machine. I also have an Echo and I don't have the same connectivity issues with it that I do with this. I liked the features available with this...portability mainly with a long battery life, but with plagued by connectivity issues I can't say I would recommend it. I have looked at reviews online since purchasing and have discovered I am not the only one that feels this way. The sound, when it is connected and responding, is amazing.",3.0
I liked my Kindle fire better. Kindle Fire was easier to hold and easier to use.,3.0
My 2 year old loves this thing. Uses it mostly for Netflix. Major issue with this is that it barely has any memory. It is very limited as to what and how much you can put on it.We have about 10 apps/games or less and Netflix app. It will not allow anything more as it has no space.,3.0
"I haven,t had them long enough",3.0
I bought this for my toddler to keep her busy on road trips or at appointments and she wasn't too fond of it. It's kinda slow and limited to what you can do. One feature I did like is that you can set a profile for kids and they'll only be able to use apps that you designate for them to use.,3.0
The best thing about the echo is the sound quality. Too many times Alexa doesn't have the answer to your question. Too many skills required to make Alexa useful. I like to use it as a radio. Will play most radio stations across the country.,3.0
More intelligent than siri however speaker performance is lacking when used for music. Sonos play1 or bose soundlink has much better sound.,3.0
"I mean, it's a crap ton of batteries for a decent price. They just die quickly.",3.0
Picture quality seemed grainy. We tried streaming video on amazon prime with it and it buffered some times even though we have an extremely fast Wi-Fi. For the price though it's not bad. We use it for our kid's apps,3.0
This product is fast a stylish. Good battery life. Helps to be a regular Amazon client.,3.0
the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told I had to deal with Amazon.Found out thru Amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it. Was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product. Had to research everything myself.,3.0
"Seems like a good value, though I'm not sure how much it allows Amazon to spy on me. Major problem, does not connect my WIFI at home.

"I was excited to purchase the Amazon Echo, but when I thought that I could carry it out on the beach I was a little disappointed. If it had the capabilities to have a battery life to use without being plugged up it would be excellent.",3.0

PPI too low for reading.. kinda regret getting it.. should've gotten a used ipad instead.,3.0
"Well, a good table for under $50 it's not bad. I ended getting the Toshiba 4k tv with built-in Chromecast so I need an inexpensive table so I wouldn't use my phone. Turns out that the tablet does have Play Store so i was unable to download Google Home. This tablet would be great for kids for a started tablet. you can also control how much time kids can spend on it. unfortunately it wasn't for since it didn't work for what i need.",3.0
"Since this is an Android 5 based tablet, I sideloaded a few necessary apps to allow it to be used essentially the same as an Android tablet, with Google play store, etc. The screen resolution, speaker, RAM are just only adequate. Otherwise, a good cheap tablet. Really need to ponder its utility before buying it.",3.0

"Bought this to replace my aging Nexus 7 (2013) version, but didn't hold a candle up to it. I knew it going in, but wanted to see for myself in person. For $80, can't hardly beat the features, but I was spoiled by arguably the best small Android tablet ever made. I knew the screen resolution was lacking, especially on an 8"" screen, but coming from the Nexus, it was a huge difference. Also, even at 4 plus years old, the processor was humming along smoothly. The extra .5 gb ram was also helpful. Anyways, back to the Fire HD 8. One advantage it had over the Nexus, was the expansion slot. I loved being able to put my media on it, but then again, the media displayed on the screen was subpar, so it's a wash. I installed Google play on it, so that it expanded its functionality, and I'm an avid Amazon conneseiur, but found the table too limiting. Ultimately returned and bought an old, discontinued Fire HD 6 for $20. The resolution almost matches that of the Nexus, so I'm happy for now.",3.0
"Th size difference is noticeable and squarish rather then rectangular, which I prefer. The Kindle unit itself is rather nice, the auto rotate and adjust being the best part. I returned this item b/c the cover is flimsy. and I was afraid I would drop it and break the kindle.",3.0
"Let me set the stage for this review: I joined a book club this year and have started reading a lot... or at least what I would consider to be a lot, which is about 2 decently-long books a month.Up until buying the Paperwhite, I was doing most of my reading on my iPhone using the Kindle app. Long story short, I ended up returning the Paperwhite after about 2 weeks. Why? Because I realized just how sporadic my reading was. I read when I'm out and about, waiting at a doctor's office, or in-line at a restaurant, etc. It became overwhelmingly apparent to me that the best E-Reader is the one you have with you at all times. For me, that's my iPhone.The actual reading experience is definitely better on the Paperwhite. However, if you're an ""on-the-go"" reader like me, then it just means you have to carry around another device. Dedicated E-Readers are for people who either truly read a ton, or have a set routine for reading. If that's not you, then stick with your phone.",3.0
"this is a great pad device, big and good display. just you have to familiar with the amazon OS and they build it for E-book, so it will a little bit slow for even web site surfing.more serious in game playing.",3.0

"I purchased this item for the home automation integration. Its pretty cool for just saying ""Alexa, turn on my kitchen lights"". Integrates with all the large players in home automation, Wink, Smartthings, Philips Hue, etc. Its also works well as a bluetooth speaker, streaming from your phone or tablet. It also streams Pandora and radio stations via TuneIn.It doesn't do anything useful other than that, besides simple queries about weather, etc.",3.0

"I got this tablet for my 2 year old after her previous tablet cracked when she dropped it, and wasn't too impressed with it. I had to wait about 3 weeks for the Wifi to be setup at home, and found out it was way too reliant on the internet for most things to work. After inserting the SD card from her other tablet I was hoping it'd be easy to view videos, pictures, and music and had such a hard time figuring it out. It took a long time for the videos and pictures to show up because I wasn't connected to Wifi, and it didn't recognize any music files. Once I did connect it, it was annoying to see that ads were displayed on the Lock Screen. Overall it's a good tablet, but I just didn't like all the apps that are installed and rely on Amazon's paid services.",3.0
The sound coming from the echo is amazing considering it's small size.,3.0
Did not last,3.0

"The echo is a nice speaker that has the added bonus of being able to respond to questions and give sometimes useful information. However in regards to it being capable of serving as the brain of an integrated, automated home, it lacks much. I purchased it to use with Philips hue bulbs and I was hoping my fire tv. Although it shares the same software with the fire, and logically should be able to work together, it does not. Echo will not connect to or control the tv. As far as the Philips hue bulbs, it can turn on individual bulbs, or even a group of bulbs IF, and only if, you remember the exact phrase or name you gave it. It cannot dim the lights, set light scenes or any of the cooler options the Philips hue bulbs are capable of. I wound up going back to using my iPhone which respond to voice command of 'hey Siri' better than the echo anyway. If I had to do it over again, I would have saved the money and gone with a simple Bluetooth speaker for my phone as it can already do many of the things the echo does. Only difference is that the phone doesn't have as big of a range for voice pickup.I did give the echo three stars, because the one thing it does well is respond to questions, like what's the weather like. That feature is interesting but not worth paying nearly $200 for.",3.0

"I am looking at the oasis and voyage but thinking they will be expensive paper weight in 3-4 years because that is the average life of kindle, this is my #4; they get slow, froze and die after 3-4 years. Moving from first gen paperwhite to the newest version, here are the noticeable changes:1. speed- this version is snappy, the new UI takes a little time to get used to.2. the LED lighting is even, no more ghost at the bottom of the page.3. cloud storage, book can be opened from the cloud and just start reading.Just like any other kindle, set up is easy, downloading over 100 titles of book to the device is fast. I do average 12-20 books a year, with the kindle of course, no worries on where to store them. Although the form factor of the oasis and voyage is very tempting but that additional price can buy lots of books!One complaint that I have is the USB cable is too short!",4.0

A real nice tablet for children and got it on sale at Bestbuy,4.0
"Purchased the tablet for my 9 month old daughter since I notice that she loves phone screens and tablets. Keep in mind isn't intend for kids her age but make sure there is adult supervision. Pluses: the tablet can take a good beating. Tons of hard tapping and even with the tough case can even take biting as well without causing any damage to the pink case. ( daughter is teething lol) . I'm a Amazon prime member,which gives access to tons of shows and free apps. So if you have Prime you can totally take advantage of a full library of entertainment. Some of the apps are great even for my 9 month old daughter works great to keep her entertained. Also when she is older I have tons of options to change and control. Also I get my own side she can't do anything unless I give her action.Cons: Average battery life 5-6hours tops of nonstop use and also wish that there was a way to lock the screen while watching Amazon, Netflix or any other video app so when my daughter taps in any direction or anywhere that the videos wouldn't stop playing.",4.0

This is a great streaming device. Easy to use and user friendly. It says it plays 4K which is a plus. I've streamed Amazon and ps Vue on here and read that games can be played too. I am a chrome cast user so am used to managing everything on my phone not a remote but the remote is nice and has voice control which is great. I just wish the fire tv app would show what you see on screen so you can navigate from your phone instead of having it look like a mousepad. It takes getting used to. Overall it is great addition to my streaming devices.,4.0
"Moving to this from the first generation Paperwhite appears to have been the right move. I love the new size, it just feels tiny and perfect in the hand. The new automatic brightness setting works quite well. I do wish I could crank up the force required to activate the page turn buttons however, as I have frequently hit them accidentally. The page turn buttons do work with gloves on which a great for reading in a tree stand.",4.0
"Paperwite is easy to hold, as I have weak wrists. Light weight and so easy to turn pages. Books download in seconds. With the light it is great to be able to read anywhere.

"This is a nice little tablet for the $60 I paid on black Friday. At the regular price I would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much Amazon content. The lock screen ads aren't much of a problem, I understand Amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 15-20 Amazon apps are a little much. It would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don't. That said, I was able to install the Google Play store and this tablet does everything I need it to do. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the purchase. It's a nice new toy. One note: In the online photos the magenta looks purple. It's actually pink. If you like purple, get a black one and a purple case.",4.0

"If you are looking for something to help you keep more organized or keep you up to date with weather, markets, and the latest news the Amazon Echo Show is what you are looking for. Honestly, the product is top of the line technology, and is easy to use as long you are patient and work with it, and read the directions. The size of it is truly perfect; it honestly reminds me of the size of normal alarm clock that would have on a nightstand, and with that it truly can serve that purpose. It also has a touch screen, and I feel it is very durable and can stand to last. The sound quality is also superb, with dual 2-inch speakers. It has Bluetooth capabilities as well, but it only works with android, Samsung, Fire OS, IOS device, excluding Mac products. The Echo Show comes in two colors black and white. The product has many different features and functions, and they can accommodate pretty much anyone‚Äôs needs. The top feature is the Alexa App, which is an application in which you can call commands and ask it questions about most anything. Then I believe the music capabilities are truly amazing and how you can ask it to play almost any song or playlist whenever you want. Also you can tell it to volume up or down as well. Another new modernized technology it has is the capability to do hands free voice command Smart Home options. A couple things that could be improved, is sometimes that it does not fully hear your exact words, and it will search for something you aren‚Äôt expecting. The other function it could have is it could have single voice recognition to only several voices, so then you don‚Äôt have the entire room trying to mess with it constantly. The price is also fair as well, for its creative capabilities it has. So if you are trying to find some new technology to add to your home the Echo Show would be a great addition for you.",4.0

We bought a 32 GB card and he's not had to delete anything.The quad-core processor is a big improvement over the previous gen model. Apps and games load quickly with not lag in running them.

While it isn't the most powerful tablet on the market it does what it was designed to do. It gets on the social media sites and the internet.

"I was pleasantly surprised that I have enjoyed the Kindle Fire. This was my first ever use of buying books on Kindle due to summer courses I was taking at the time in May/June 2016. WHAT I LIKED- Kindle Books Synched on MacBook and Fire tablet: very helpful when it came time to write my papers. The highlights I made while I read the book on the tablet synched to the version I read on the MacBook desktop. This helped a ton, especially with things like formatting the footnotes.- Watching Videos: cool little feature while you watch a video you can tap the screen and it will list the actors who are currently one the screen. - Amazon Shopping: I can now understand people's Amazon shopping addictions.l I will give it to Amazon, this tablet became my gateway to using Prime and countless hours of online browsing. Prior to this I rarely purchase items online, I can see how they have made it so easy across platforms. - Portability: I like that I will bring this with me for my general online browsing and reading needs rather than having to use my laptop or my phone. WHAT I DID NOT LIKE- Sign-on Screen Ads:There is no way to turn them off. I suppose for $39/49 depending if you purchased on a sale, the advertisers are subsidizing the cost of the tablet. However, I wished this was stated as a ""feature"" before purchasing it, I may have paid the money and upgraded to the next Kindle if I had known it could not be turned off. - Turning Off/Standby Mode: This took some time to get used to rather than an issue. When you turn the tablet off, it is really on a standby mode so the batteries will drain. You have to hold the button a little longer and make sure it is turned OFF. - Weather App: I don't know if this is just my tablet, the weather app does not update as soon as you open it. It takes minutes if at all to update with the current weather. I have not been able to find in any forums if other people are experiencing the same issue. I have instead downloaded and used other weather apps. But at this point the app is worthless. - Screen Resolution: It's not the best, but I got used to it. For reading and occasional video viewing purposes it is sufficient. - Screen Dimmer/Blue Light Mode: I read and use the tablet at night, and have gotten sensitive to the brightness of the tablet screen. And the system's default dimmer and Blue Light feature is awful. The Blue light app allows you to set the color tone however, it is so orange it makes it unreadable. The app I use instead is called Bluelight Blocking. And even dimming the brightness with the slider was still too bright for me. So I have had to download the app Dimly so be able to set the brightness.",4.0
Bought this tablet for my grandson and he loves it.,4.0
so far it has been working really well especially for the one's it was bought for. It's their first time using one and everything seems to work well. It takes real nice picture's and is very durable.,4.0
This tablet from Amazon can do most things like the bigger more expensive tablets at a fraction of the cost. The two complaints I have with it which are minor is the camera is not very good especially in low light and the battery does not last as long as an Ipads. Other than that it has plenty of apps and things that it can do like Netflix etc.,4.0
"This is perfect for young children and comes ready to use straight out of the box. The case is very well built to protect the tablet and the device is actually pretty light and easy to hold. Once you sign in with your 'parent' account, you can set up your child's profile and it's ready to go. Easy to navigate menus with great parental controls - this tablet truly delivers safe content and games for hours of enjoyment. The key is to load new content while you have access to wifi so the books, games and videos are available while traveling.",4.0
"I'm no battery expert, but based upon using these in the same devices that I've used name brand batteries, I notice no difference in performance. Notably, when I used them in a recording wrist pulse oximeter, the amount of time that these lasted was identical to all other brands.",4.0
Simple product - great battery life - great for those just browsing web and playing games.Don't care for creating a second account other than email for amazon store and wish google play store came pre installed.,4.0
"First off the tablet is $50 so don't go in expecting it to be on par with the latest iPad. For the price you pay though, you get a really good tablet. Screen is a little lower than 720p, but you have access to all of the Kindle books, Amazon Prime, the new Fire OS, which looks alot better than the ""all black"" on the last few Kindle Fire's. This model is only 8gb but storage is expandable, I have a 64gb Micro SD in my tablet. Recommended.",4.0
"Good device for anyone to use- simple, basic yet fun.",4.0
"Good price, well packaged. I have not used them for any real duration yet. They are shrink wrapped. However, unlike the 9 volt batteries, you can twist the package and get through the plastic wrapper.",4.0
I was very pleased with the Amazon Fire 7 inch tablet. The product is priced right making it a great buy and value.,4.0
"Was looking for a simple tablet to use during my commute. This fits the bill. App store is limited, but this is good for simple web surfing or watching videos. Lightweight too. Only thing I don't like are the ads on the unlock screen (but, this is minor considering the price).",4.0
"For the price you really can't beat this tablet. The picture looks good, amazon has a great game, movie and music catalog. So if your looks big for something just to view movies on, play games or surf the web get this one because for the price it can't be beat!",4.0
I had to replace my original Kindle and decided to buy the Kindle fire. The Fire has so many more abilities than my old Kindle but it is difficult to read in direct sunlight.,4.0
He loves electronics around Christmas so this was right up his alley! He loves telling Alexa to do things like turn up the thermostat or to play songs,4.0
We did get this when it was in sale for about 50$ and for that this is an incredible value tablet perfect for anyone who wants a screen without paying premium prices. Build quality is fine and screen isn't the best but definitely usable.,4.0
if you use it for certain things it's great. Can find most everything on it. Only a few things that can't be downloaded or found in the appstore,4.0
These are AA batteries and they work. They do seem to die a bit faster in my Speedlight then duracells but maybe I just use it more since I have the 48 pack.,4.0
Didn't seem to last long,4.0
No longer have to carry a multitude of books when traveling. Makes travels do much easier,4.0
Really nice. Small enough to cary in a purse or brief case. Easy to use and lighting is good. Just need to buy a case to protect the glass.,4.0
The is an entry level tablet for those who are looking for a budget tablet. I believe you can only access to Amazon App Store - which has fewer apps as compared to Apple Store and Google Play.,4.0
"Works great but wants you to buy subscription to get some music you may like, just found out it supports dish network",4.0
My nephew likes the 'large' size of the Fire tablet as it's significantly larger than his phone.,4.0
Currently this is the fifth version of the Kindle Fire that I purchased since they came out. Purchased this one due to its ability to maximize storage with a SD card unlike the other ones I have. It seemed to not run as smooth as my Kindle Fire HDX once I started adding apps to it which is not a problem for me since I use other tablets for that. This was mainly purchased to download shows and movies from Amazon Prime to watch offline.,4.0
We enjoy this product more than our roku device. It works great.,4.0
"Runs Great, very efficient for what we use it for.",4.0
"Hands down you can't go wrong with this tablet. Especially if its on sale and lower than the normal $50 retail price. Sure some google apps might not be in the market place, but a majority are and if your looking for just another tablet for mobile games or another screen for Netflix or Hulu this tablet would do just fine.",4.0
"As with my review of the other batteries I reviewed, they're batteries. They all work and provide approximately 1.5vdc as supposed to.",4.0
Echo is a great product that continues to improve. I love the white!,4.0
Using the Echo is very easy and it creates a great addition to any smart home.,4.0

"Recently purchased this amazon fire box. I am still learning how to work everything. I am enjoying it so far. You do have to have a Netflix account and alot of the other applications to use alot of things. However, their is a work around for everything lol. I will possibly invest in more of these down the line and maybe get my family to finally cut the cord also.",4.0
"This tablet is great for kids, but also for adults who want something they can share with their children. I love the amazon free time on it. You can set time limits for your kids and it helps a lot with limiting time.",4.0
I originally purchased the Google Home as a gift for my husband. He quickly was frustrated with Google Home as it didn't respond to what he was as asking. The Echo is much better equipped to answer questions and follow commands than its competitors.,4.0
"Everything you want in a tablet. Size is good, price is great.",4.0
"Alexa is great , is a great house hold tool around the house , timers alarm , sleep machine everything u need",4.0
"in my eyes, they die to quickly",4.0
A tablet for under $50. What a good deal. Thanks Amazon.,4.0
"Second time ordering these and it probably wont be the last. Very impressed with the run time and the price is right (especially if you are a Prime member.) It's been proven to me over many years both by my own research and feedback from customers that when it comes to branded alkaline batteries the differences between Energerzier, Duracell, Radio Shack, Panasonic Ray-O-Vac and Amazon are so negligible as to make price the real deciding factor",4.0
I got this on sale for 33 dollars and I expected something different because of the low price. I would pay a hundred for a replacement if this one ever breaks. Very good product.,4.0
I purchased the Fire Tablet with expectations of a average performing tablet at best. I was surprised to see that the tablet performed way better than expected and is still doing so. I would recommend this tablet to anyone that wants a good performing tablet without a HD screen.,4.0
Alexa is a very good product. It is nice in appearance and style. Voice quality is good and clear. Alexa should offer more products to folks who don't have amazon prime just to keep interest in the product. It is a little pricy along with extra items you need to buy to get alexa to give more functions.,4.0
This is a great Tablet at a really great price. The best part is if you happen to break it just buy a new one,4.0
Great product. I‚Äôm at the beginning stages of having a smart home and this was the perfect addition.,4.0
"Delivered a crisp display but had trouble with the keyboard size, using a stylus helped!",4.0
"I do love the Echo. I loved it so much, I bought 2 plus a tap. The only / biggest problems are that some times she doesn't hear / understand me. Also, she doesn't have a Bluetooth connection to my stereo. Otherwise, we use it all of the time.",4.0
Black Friday buy for the family. Good entertainment for the kiddos,4.0
Purchased as gifts for kids and they really enjoy them.,4.0
Grandkids and adult parents love it. The parents texted and the grandkids play games.,4.0
"I like the overall performance, especially the remote. User interface can be better/improvement needed ... purchase of apps is automatic and need additional layers of checks/authentication",4.0
It does what it's supposed to do very minimal freezing second or two on occasion,4.0
I bought this for my 10 year old son so he could read books and of course play games. I bought a 16gb micro SD card to use with it because I knew the 8gb wouldn't be enough.My son loves it! He reads his books and plays all types of games. And thanks to the Amazon Underground app most of his games are free. While this tablet doesn't have enough power for me it is perfect for him!,4.0
I do not know much about this tablet and have not quite figured out how to use it yet but it seems like a great little tablet for a first time user.,4.0
"I love my Amazon Echo. I use it for my lighting, to play music, shopping lists, timers, information and the list goes on. Makes simple tasks a little more fun. Love getting my shopping list on my phone!",4.0
"Pleased with the expiration dates, these are a good trade off, of cost and quality",4.0
Work as well as the expensive batteries. What more could we ask for,4.0
"Alexa sits in my home office and plays music for me throughout the day. She is also quite helpful when my children ask me questions that I don't have time to look up for them. Fun product, easy information gathering.",4.0
For the money you can't beat what you get. iPads still rule and are far better when you aren't connected to wifi but given the cost difference I think this is the best andriod to compete with it.,4.0
Very nice and easy to use and the kindle is great.,4.0
"Bought this for my 2 yr old. Easy to use. Good parental controls. As long as you're not comparing it directly to an iPad, then it's a pretty good tablet for the $$",4.0

Great device and easy setup.The ease of use for the kids are also great.,4.0

I bought the Fire TV in able to watch Prime Videos. I have a Smart TV and an Apple TV. They all work about the same they each have their unique features features.,4.0
"I really like the Amazon Echo. It gives me information w/o my having to log online. Alexa's voice is clear and the information concise. I like the sleek look & the blue ""ring"" that allows you to know when you have connected with Alexa. There have been quite a few questions she cannot answer. Hopefully as we become used to the Echo and how to phrase questions our luck will improve.",4.0
"This Fire TV is a better choice than the Fire Stick from a connectivity standpoint if you have a LAN connection or if you have potential wireless connections. It also has the advantage of expandable storage, although I've not found a need for it yet. As with the newest Apple TV, the Fire TV uses a graphic intensive interface. Although the Fire TV doesn't have the Apple's volume control, selection is somewhat more reliable than the touch pad interface used by Apple. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the way Amazon chooses to organize the selections. All in all, the Fire TV is the best way to take advantage of your Amazon Prime Membership.",4.0
It's a very basic laptop. It's a good price. It fills all the basic needs.,4.0
We bought the Amazon Fire TV device to watch streaming TV and it works great! Love the guide feature!,4.0

"I Purchased Three Of These For Family Members As Christmas Gifts On Black Friday For Only $34.99 each!!Pros ; Price Is Great, Responds Well To Touch and Running Applications, Small, Portable, Again The Price Is The Best Pro To This Tablet.Cons : Main Homepage Runs Ads In The Background?? Why?? , Apps Are Only Available Through The Amazon App Store Making A Very Limited Selection Compared To Google Play and The App Store For Apple But Again This Equal To The Tax I Paid On My iPad Air.",4.0

"Amazon Echo is a smart home device, but it's not quite as smart as Google Home. It also doesn't integrate with your smartphone as anything more than a mediocre bluetooth speaker. I don't care about ordering products from Amazon using my voice, and I wish Alexa would answer my more obscure questions like Google does.Where the Echo shines right now though is with smart home integration. I use the Echo to control my Philips Hue lights and control all of my home theater devices through my Harmony Hub (and soon, full control over my Dish Hopper through a Dish/Amazon partnership). It's a bit more expensive than I would have liked, and I ended up adding an Echo Dot to the other room, so I didn't have to yell for Alexa to hear me.In hindsight, if you don't need a mediocre bluetooth speaker, get the Echo Dot instead (which you can hook to speakers of your own choice).",4.0
It's a great tablet the price was excellent best buy in boardman ohio,4.0

"I exchanged the paper white that I had bought for this Voyage. This is thinner, lighter and just easier to hold than the paperwhite. Still getting used to the archive system since I had a Nook before, bit of a learning curve. But I like the Kindle interface better than the Nook, the book suggestions and shopping for books is much better. The only thing I miss is that the Kindle doesn't tell you what % battery you have left, it just shows you the bar in the battery symbol.",4.0

"The Amazon Fire TV box is better than using the ""smart"" software built-in on any Blu-ray player or TV I've owned. Those brands include Sony, Mitsubishi, and Samsung. It is very responsive when navigating menus and making selections. If you're not an Amazon Prime member, be prepared to have that in your face - this is an Amazon device after all. The remote is minimalist in style and has the mic built-in for speaking to Alexa, which is a plus in my book.",4.0
"Its nice to have a companion that only talks when spoken to ,Alexa is the only women who doesn't argue lol",4.0

"Purchased two of these tablets for Christmas presents (10 yr old and 7 yr old children). Had researched them prior to buying so new what they were capable of and what they weren't. Pleasantly surprised with overall performance and durability. No, they are not iPads, didn't expect them to be, but at a sixth of the cost they do their job extremely well.",4.0
"Now that we have begun to figure out how to use this, we are liking it much better. It didn't want to work well for us. When I called Amazon's help line, the person told me I couldn't get Amazon music if I was only Prime member. I had to get the premium package. I called again and got a more knowledgeable person and got it straightened out. At times Alexa has trouble getting things right. Learning curve.",4.0
"If you are a Prime member and use Kindle for reading, this a great tablet. I wish there were more apps made to work in the Fire tablet, like NFL Mobile and NFL Fantasy.",4.0

"Bought this as part of the Black Friday sale. For $40, it serves well as a light use tablet (Skype, e-mail, video, etc.). The ads and heavy Amazon product front load push are annoying.

"This is an excellent choice for an e-reader. I purchased it specifically for a vacation in the sun. It did a great job, was easy to use and overall allowed me to easily read out in the bright sun. the backlit display at night was very nice and makes reading a breeze anytime without problem. I have an older nook book that is color. I chose the amazon version so that I could subscribe to the unlimited monthly reading program. in comparison between the 2 brands I do like the nook better for easy of moving between pages - I haven't figured that out quite yet on the kindle, but I'm sure it's quite easy. there's also no person that I can quickly drop into the store to ask a question on how to do something. if you are a person who likes being shown how to use a device. I know my mom who is 80 might have a little problem with some getting the screen at the top to pull down but 95% of the people most likely won't. Best thing I like and am glad I invested was the backlight.",4.0

I purchased my Eco for the holidays. It took me considerable time to get minimally operational. It is rather complex to hook up to other devises. So far it is only hooked up to my Dot.

"The Kindle is just great for my mom, who would mostly just read on it and download the bible.",4.0
"Provides information, services, and also amusement.",4.0
"Relatively inexpensive (I guess the multiplack of Kirkland batteries sold by Costco would be cheaper, but I didn't want to buy a ton of these, I needed them quickly and they were delivered right to my Mom's house in two days....well worth it), and they seem to work well...only time will tell if they hold up in the Fulcrum 30010-301 LED Battery-Operated Stick-On Tap Light, Silver, 3 Pack I purchased along with them",4.0
Have this set up in the living room. Make sure to mute it when you're watching Youtube videos or stuff will start happening...and you'll run out screaming...which I've found can be very embarrassing.,4.0
"Nice Toy. In the future, when I get more accessories to work with it, will be more rewarding.",4.0

"For the price, it's tough to complain but it does occasionally stutter or get slow downs. Overall, you can't find a tablet at this price that will outperform but if you do have the extra money, I would use it for the new Fire HD 8 instead.",4.0
A week after my purchase this item went on sale. I think best buy should refund he difference without me having to drive 45 minutes 1 way to return and repurchase as the store advised when I call them . it's not like you don't have my credit card information.,4.0
Great performance!,4.0
"The screen is adequate and the service is reliable. I did not play with it much due to it being a gift. Sadly the person it was purchased for was unable to hold onto it long enough to use it (elderly lady). I still have it though, and it's a great little backup to my primary tablet.",4.0
"programming Echo is time consuming, I still have not gotten everything programmed that I would like. We don't use it as much as I thought we would either.",4.0
"Good tablet for reading, playing and browsing. Value for money",4.0
I recently purchased this product for my nephew for his birthday he loves it and you can set parental setting to block unwanted content.,4.0
"Bought this as a gift for my mother so that she could watch Netflix and hulu while in the hospital. Took her a bit to get used to as she was used to her ipad but overall I like this product. Only drawback is lack of appstore content (namely clash of clans, clash royale, pokemon go, etc)",4.0
My internet is so awful that streaming music is so choppy and sporadic it reminds me of vinyl records #likeabroken record,4.0

It is not an iPad but for $40 it is a good tablet. Really good for reading.,4.0
great device so far. still learning new features on it daily,4.0

This tablet works very well and the price is excellent. I bought for my nephew and he is so happy.,4.0
Nice tablet for a great price as I purchased per black Friday sale on-line,4.0
I got very good customer service explaining the difference in tablets and Kindle Fire is what was suggested to me as all I want to do is use it as a ereader.,4.0
Nice e-reader. A bit smaller and definitely lighter than the Paperwhite. 'Whiter' screen still easy on the eyes. A bit expensive for just a reader however.,4.0
"It is okay I guess, but not very user friendly. I probably wouldn't recommend to a friend for this reason",4.0
"My son loves this tablet. I would recommend for kids under teenage age. Great display, not much storage but can add SD card.",4.0
"I had this device for few weeks before returning it and getting the Kindle Voyage. But the only difference between the two is the design, page press buttons and the auto dimming light as they both have the same screen. After purchasing this device, I immediately devoured three books in the course of a weekend. Which, sadly, is more than I've read in about two years. This device has reinvigorated my live for reading since it is so portable and the battery lasts for quite a while. I would suggest that you get the genuine leather cover for this device when you buy it as it just adds that little extra to the purchase. Overall, I would recommend anyone that wants to read more, reads often, or reads many books at once to take the plunge and buy this device. Plus, new books can be upwards of $20-$30 sometimes. This little device will carry all of your books and only costs the price of a few hard copy books. Plus if you need a physical copy, you can always borrow from the library.",4.0
Decent batteries at a pretty good price. I will buy again.,4.0
This is a vvery good device that serves its purpose extremely well and a at aprice thats afforadable and well worth it i would recomend it to friends and family,4.0

"I bought this for my 91 year old mother. She had a kindle, but there were too many buttons and she had difficulty using it. She still has difficulty using this kindle, but likes it much better. There is only one button to press.",4.0
"Nothing is ever perfect. I'm sure my product has some flaws in it, which I'm okay with. As long as they don't effect the usage I'm happy. Sometimes takes a second to register me pushing the letters, but nothing too big.",4.0

"Performance of the device is good, meets expectations.",4.0
Great product. Enhances my TV options!! I enjoy the ability to have access to many programs when I want them.,4.0
"This is probably one of the best boxes out there. Unfortunately they changed the new model. The white indicator light does not stay on, to let you know the device is on. Did this in the previous model. The power cord is extremely short should be an other foot longer.Changes they made were not for the better but the device produces excellent 1080 p picture",4.0
Nice product easy to use. Enjoy it very much watching shows with the family.,4.0
I bought this hoping to make good use of my 4K TV but realized that there is very little 4K content out there. But at least I'll be ready then.,4.0

"I enjoy my kindle tv, it beats paying for cable every month ������",4.0

They work great and a price nicely,4.0
I m hoping that it doesn't have the same battery port charging issues that the first generation had.,4.0
Bought this as a gift.. Good price and features for this Kindle,4.0
Great as a streaming music ayer that has other functions. The quality itself of the speaker is great.,4.0
Just as good as more expensive batteries.,4.0
"Overall good, not great. I get tired of having to push the button to talk to her and she can't find a lot of the music I liked. Am getting some Dots to see how they will work. For price point it works.",4.0
This is good tablet for price of $49.99. The camera is not really bad. One reason why i dont't like Amazon tablet and cellpone is you can't download some apps like magic jack and chikka apps. I like this 2 apps because im using it international.,4.0
"I bought this for my son to have access to Netflix and a few games. Although I think the parental controls are too complicated, I really like the tablet.",4.0
"Ok, so Alexa can't answer everything but so far I've asked the same questions to Siri and Alexa and get better answers from Alexa. Looking forward to growing my home automation system now. Volume is pretty good. Also bought a dot which will be used with my receiver.",4.0
"I would definitely buy it again, but it does not have the ambient light sensor like the cheaper voyage does to turn the brightness up and down automatically in the dark or sun. For a product of this price, it shouldn't be missing any features. Otherwise it is great, light, and the text refreshes quickly and is crisp.",4.0
It's hard to beat the quality for the price it cost. Great for the kids.,4.0
Was more expensive than other batteries on amazon and the name brands are definitely better. Either buy these in bulk for a discount or go with the name brands for the same price.,4.0
Love this product. Glad I upgraded! The features make it easy to read while traveling by car or plane.,4.0
Listens to my every word and isn't insulted when i tell her she is dumb as a stone!,4.0
I love Alexa. She is great for information and music. It also keeps the kids occupied.,4.0

"I loved this kindle fire tablet. You can't beat the price. It's great for in the car and as a back up system. It's not as good as my kindle paper white, but like I said, great for a back up and it has other features that the paper white doesn't.",4.0
"Bought it for my mom,it's going to be easy for her to use.",4.0
Got this gift for my girlfriend daughter and she loves it good deal thanks,4.0
I enjoy the kindle fire but it is not meant for heavy lifting. Good for reading books and web searching but Amazon App store doesnt have many of the normal apps found in Google Play or Apple App Store. Great value for the price however,4.0
We have an iPad but bought this for the kids unlimited prime content. We have enjoyed it and it has a lot that the iPad doesn't. The menu could be more friendly but I like the parental limits it has.,4.0
"Ok. So it's super cool being able to just talk to something that's right there in the kitchen and ask questions, set a timer, check the news or even listen to music. You just have to get over the freak out of who else might be able to listen in if hackers find a way!",4.0
"Only downfall is there are lots of pop up ads, otherwise a great inexpensive tablet!",4.0
"Good tablet. Keeps my neice busy for hours, and we usually have to take it from her so she can sleep.",4.0

I wanted to find a tablet to give to my grandkids. Being able to spend 37.50 on Thanksgiving made this a no brainier for a tablet to give them. I was able to purchase 3 and they are really enjoying it. It may not be top of the line but it works great for them.,4.0
"I think it is worth the sale price of $150.00 but it has limitations. For example it shows my calendar but you can only see the first item, then if you ask for more, you see the next 3 or so. I The screen is updating with trivia...some interesting some not so much. I bet the next generation is a lot better",4.0
I would go for the Echo because you can talk to it. The tap you have to touch it before you can talk to it. The speaker is good though for it's size.,4.0
I've had multiple Amazon Fire tablets. They are a great bargain. I love the ease of use and functionality. The only downfall is that it is really slow to charge.,4.0

As always amazon delivers.. LOL On par with apple TV. Great product.,4.0
I was looking for a reader that I could use outdoors and found this device to be excellent outdoors. The battery life thus far has been excellent. It took some adjustment going from my Kindle fire to the Kindle paperwhite. Overall I am very happy with this new device.,4.0
It was a Xmas girt for my granddaughter but read on it's abilities,4.0
"This has been a great replacement for my daughters Leap Pad. The parental controls are very functional and the year free download of everything has been worthwhile. I really appreciate the usage timers - they are customizable and I can set a time limit for apps, a different time limit for reading and a third time limit for videos. The case seems sturdy and should prevent damages due to drops. On top of this, it is a fully functional Kindle, and I am able to use it when she is not!",4.0
"Overall, not a bad tablet. The price is good and the features are pretty nice. It was bought as a gift and I can say that she loved it.",4.0
When paired with amazon music alexa is great. It will play any song you can think of. I havent used it for much else yet,4.0

Good gift for my grandchild. She loves it. I'm a little unhappy with the navigation of the tablet from exiting a screen to return to the home screen. Especially when wanting to exit a game or video screen.,4.0
"My new tablet, is easy to use, it is also very easy to travel with.",4.0
"I had the first generation FireTV and it was great. I wanted something that was a little faster for playing games and also for using with Plex. Plex works so much better on this generation than the first. More of the videos that I have can be played direct instead of being transcoded. Games also seem much smoother on this device than the first generation but it is hard to tell due to the limited types of games on the Amazon App store. If you are looking for a device that can stream Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go, Amazon Prime Video, and ESPN and still be used for casual gaming then this is the device for you.",4.0
"Bought for my 3 children ages 3,4,and 5. They all seem to love them. My only problem is the battery life is low so they are always complaining that they are shutting off.For a parent that is not to big a problem unless you work from home and are trying to keep them quite.",4.0
"I bought this after hearing the sound quality of the speakers at my friends house. I also wanted something voice activated in the kitchen to keep handsfree. The sound quality is good. The noise cancelling mics are great at moderate volume. Only downside is no battery operation (it must always be plugged in). Also, even though it has bluetooth and can be paired to a smartphone, you cannot use the echo to pass through phone calls (Only music). For IOT toys its fun for voice control (ex: nest, etc). The skills are mostly cheesy though. Fun toy that allows easy access to prime music, pandora, etc.",4.0
"At this low price compared to competitors, it's a convenient solution for a variety of applications. I keep it in the living room as a controller, having loaded the Harmony app to control activities and devices via the Harmony hub.",4.0
"Enjoying my Tap, asking Alexa questions, and the small form factor makes it easy to take along while traveling. Decent battery life and sound for such a small speaker. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars, was the difficulty in connecting the Tap to public wifi's such as hotels, in my situation...takes some effort.",4.0
A little faster than the firestick and has 4k. Can only do 4k at 30hz and 4k is not in the menu screens. (Can be a little confusing when thinking the device is entirely 4k when you turn it on and your tv says it's only 1080p and you have 4k enabled on a 4k tv.,4.0
It's fun to have but you need a lot of extras to get the most out of it. I wasn't really ready to buy the subscriptions (Spotify) and other things you need to get everything out of it but maybe I'll work my way up to it.,4.0
I prefer spending the extra $70 or $80 to get the echo,4.0
"It's not a very powerful tablet. I needed something just to view Netflix and some other videos. Not to mention play some music and look at photos. Other than that I think it's too weak, not good for gaming. For the price though, you can't beat it.",4.0
Great product and service at best buy great to help me purchase,4.0

"Love that this now has a sd slot. Its amazing to watch movies that we downloaded, read books. Its a little slow but for the price its amazing. Great speakers and picture",4.0
"They're batteries. They're cheaper than Wal-Mart. What more could you want I don't have stats on whether they last longer than Duracell or Energizer, but at this price I don't think it really matters. The brand Amazon Basics has tons of useful stuff all the way from batteries to laptop bags and more. It seems like Amazon wasn't enough of a household name so they're trying to make it so everything in your house has the Amazon name on it, but I ain't mad let them take over. I just wish they had an Amazon Basics brand for disposable diapers.",4.0
Bought for my 3 year old so she could be like her older sisters and this little device doesn't disappoint. I wish there were more silicone cases available for it and I absolutely can't stand the ads Amazon puts on these Fire tablets.,4.0
Good features and quality. Would be nice if it worked better in low light. Should have stepped up for the backlit one. This is nice if your conditions are bright.,4.0

Very good value.,4.0
Very good Product. Easy to read with the extra lightings. Look wise it is good,4.0
This thing is not half bad for the price. Bought it as a gift for my wife and she loves it.,4.0
I was attracted by the price of the base Kindle but in the end opted for the Paperwhite as it was illuminated and had rounded edges which felt more comfortable. Definitely worth the extra few dollars in my opinion. My local library offers free loans of ebooks which I have been taking advantage of. There are also many free books online - samples and classics with expired copyrights. Battery life is good and the device is lightweight. Even in bright ambient light you get minimal screen glare. I prefer this to a physical book which I never expected.,4.0
Simple easy to use. Plug and play so to speak. You should read the manual that comes installed on it. Can read anywhere with no glare at all. tt even has a browser for the web that is in the preliminary stages but it is pretty good.,4.0
Perfect tablet for my 7 year old girl. She really enjoys it.,4.0
"These don't last quite as long as Duracell, but for the price it's hard to complain. Nice basic batteries. No issues except for slightly shorter lifespan.",4.0

I bought three of these for my kids ages 7 to 14 and it works great for what they use them for. My only wish is that it came with Google Play Store but we were able to install that separately and works well.,4.0
So far we like. Wish I could control tv. It's lil expensive but seems to work great. Decent speakers as well.,4.0
Accessable for all TVs in the house and not having to buy a stick for each tv would be 5*'s,4.0
Great reader for reading in bed. Light weight easy to use.,4.0

"Awesome sound which was unexpected. It's nice seeing info on the screen such as recipes, song lyrics, weather, etc.",4.0
"She tells jokes, controls my lights and music, sets alarms... I actually got it on sale soooo I think it's pretty worth it. Not sure if full price is a good deal or not.",4.0
"I own several Amazon Echoes. I use them primarily to listen to the vast Amazon Prime Music library, which gives you access to millions of songs for a reasonable annual fee. The sound quality of the Echo is excellent, though is lacking in deep bass extension. Overall I would recommend the Amazon Echo.",4.0
"Really good and solid tablet, especially for kids. Highly recommend that you buy the case that goes with it too.",4.0
"Works great. Nice upgrade over the Fire stick as it has an Ethernet port. Heavily focused on Amazon content (duh) but if you have a Prime account, this is a must.",4.0
We really are enjoying asking Alexa questions and she is connected to our Sonos system playing music around the house. She doesn‚Äôt always understand me. Not sure if it is her or me.,4.0

They're batteries. They seem to last as long as big name brands for much less cost.,4.0
Nice and cheap last just as long as the expensive ones that claim they last twice as long than the others. Had a few duds from the others and these so no big complaints.,4.0
Bought for my daughter for middle school reading. It's perfect,4.0
This 8 inch Fire is definitely better than the cheaper 7 inch. It works fine enough for teens to play games and watch movies.,4.0
"This is my 2 nd Echo purchase. I have had one for awhile. This was for my daughter. We love Alexa. She is in our kitchens and helps with everything; recipes, kid chore list, grocery list, music, weather, timer, story teller, the list is endless. She gets confused occasionally but she is usually still amusing. We are all glad she became part of our family.",4.0
"Have had good success with these and the Amazon Basics AA's as well. They come in a cardboard box, in sets of two which is handy to grab, although I still wish they were not plastic wrapped at all. That said it is far easier and takes up less space than the typical packaging from other brands.Battery life seems fine with these as it did for AA (I had less success with the Amazon Basics 9v which had a horrible battery life).",4.0
For $50 the kindle fire 7 is a bargain. I had the original kindle and the difference in functionality is night and day. The only minus is amazon prime is now $99 a year and it's hard to justify that unless you shop amazon alot. But still overall a great deal.,4.0
Excellent tablet and you can't beat the price. Make great gifts for Birthdays or for Christmas.,4.0

The tablet is good for basic uses and is low cost.,4.0
"I purchased three of these tablets as Christmas gifts for my kids. It was a great deal since Best Buy had them on sale for $33/ea. They were very excited to get their own tablet. The 7 inch is a bit small for my taste, however, great for kids. The Amazon service that provides ample apps for kids is a great deal since you can add up to four kids on one account.",4.0
"I tested this item before I gave it as a gift. It is simple enough for the needs of browsing, social media and entertainment. Definitely best price for simple needs compared to spending $100s on an iPad",4.0
Loved the amazon fire tablet. I bought it as a Christmas present for my 4yo. I bought a case too because as you know kids tend do drop things... this tab was awesome because it linked up with my amazon account and I had control on what my child was viewing. I liked that the price was great and the product is durable. My son thinks it's awesome.,4.0
"I bought three of these devices for my niece and nephews and my parents both have one and absolutely love them, so I decided to get one myself. This was my first personal foray into an Android based device being a tried and true iOS devotee, with a Mac and iPad. I will say that for this price point and for what it was designed to do, the Fire tablet is great. The OS and processor make it a bit clunky and it's definitely not designed for high level graphics or photo editing, but for basic activities, it works great. I particularly like the easy to use and transport size. I still prefer to read on my kindle but I do read on here as well. If you are looking for a basic tablet to use for movies, music, reading and other media driven activities (ideal for Amazon Prime members), this is perfect.",4.0
Very easy to setup. The navigation through the system is very simple. Great product,4.0
"picked up a tablet because my laptop is over 3 years old, does a good job, sound levels are good, nice picture for a non hd product. Lots of pre installed apps and the ads on the sleep screen are annoying but for around 50 bucks not a bad product.",4.0
Got these on black Friday for early Christmas gifts. Very good buy on a pretty good tablet.,4.0
I don't encourage a lot of TV watching so the Amozon Fire was a good substitute. It's great for travel. My granddaughter plays games as she learns. Good preparation tablet for introducing her to her next tablet in a few months. Using this one to teach responsibility as she learns.,4.0
Very easy to install. Great way to get the most benefits from amazon prime membership by watching movies and shows. So easy to use my 5 yo can use it!,4.0

Good tablet but no YouTube kids like on iPhone. Don't expect iPhone/pad quality very basic AppStore for children,4.0
"Nice. Processor power was never a problem with the original Fire TV, so for streaming purposes, the new chip mainly serves to support 4K Ultra HD playback. Provided you have a 4K TV with an HDCP 2.2-enabled HDMI port, along with a fast Internet connection (Amazon recommends 15Mbps), you can stream Ultra HD content from either Amazon Video or Netflix. The Fire TV even labels Ultra HD content from Amazon video on the home screen, so you can quickly jump in.",4.0

"I like the closed ecosystem, your kids don't see what they shouldn't, what i didn't like my daughter made a purchase by mistake on day 2, turnoff the the one click buying. also i don't like that its set up like its the parents device with the child using it, so there are two steps to logging in. also i don't like the lack of google apps, the device itself itself has a great screen and weight, the bumper is tough and easy to clean, and overall i would recommend it for a 4yo.",4.0
"Got these mainly for use in Xbox one controllers. They don't last quite as long as energizer lithium (I'd say maybe 75 as long) but for the quantity and price, its a good deal. Will continue to use.",4.0
It's awesome being able to have 4K capability and being able to play games but it does get laggy at times.,4.0
"I love the new kindle fire. I bought the original fire back in 2011 and this is definitely an upgrade. The firmware is better, the battery last longer and the screen is better. All this for $40....can't beat that deal.",4.0

Perfect tablet for younger kids. It is inexpensive so when they inevitably break it you will not be so mad.,4.0

"The new Kindle Voyage is quite a step forward for the Kindle dedicated reader line. It is a beautiful device - almost like something from Apple. I like the lighted screen and the page forward and back ""buttons"" on the sides of the device. But it is rather pricey - not yet convinced it is worth the upcharge.",4.0
This was a present for my father and he hasn't complained one bit about it.,4.0
The perfect gift for someone who needs company. She talks to Alexa and told me she appreciates that's Alexa is very polite.,4.0
I bought this for my dad in his late 60s mainly to listen to music and read ebooks borrowed from the library. I set it up for him and he loves it. I just don't like that it has ads on the start up unless you pay to get rid of them.,4.0
Great HD features. Makes it easy to travel with and be on the go and see all your shows.,4.0
"Bought this to keep all my ebooks on to carry in my purse. So I could read when was stuck at the hospital, etc.Well, gee the free wifi at the hospital has a sign-on screen. Couldn't get to that. Did some reading (on my phone) I think I can fix it the next time I need to be there. Just disappointed that it wouldn't allow the sign-on page to display right out of the box!!!",4.0
Brought this as a gift for a friend and she loves it.,4.0
It functions well and meets all my needs as an entry level tablet. The only downside is that everything on it is geared toward amazon but the price makes up for it.,4.0

this was purchased for my granddaughter for her birthday,4.0

Bought the Fire Tv over the Fire stick due to the fact that it has more memory. Great for streaming. Only problem is that it freezes sometimes and you have to hard reset it.,4.0
Lightning fast no but still a great and inexpensive way to get the latest book release and maybe to check the news. Price was unbeatable,4.0
"This is a great tablet for kids with lot of good contents and Amazon's 2 year No-Questions asked warranty along with a free one year subscription for contents made it even better. Parental control on this is great, both us as parents and my son love this device. The only drawback I see is that the charging cable is very small length that it's hard to charge it without putting it on top of something to reach to a regular height outlet.",4.0
good tablet for the price. only drawback is the limited apps for the fire compared to android tablets,4.0
"Each battery only lasts a few days on my wireless mouse.Update: the problem is actually with my mouse or computer other batteries are also draining too fast. Nevertheless, it would be good if these Amazon batteries stated their capacity.",4.0
Love this Kindle paperwhite!! It is easily carried in my purse!!,4.0
"So far, works just as it should. Haven't used it over WiFi, as I have it direct connected to my modem. I love that it came with a remote, but wish it could use a universal one, but the phone app works just ads well, too. Wish there was an off button, not just sleep mode.",4.0
Bought it for my dad who loves tech that his life easier the alexa integration is fantastic.,4.0
YouTube plays only in the desktop version not the mobile version,4.0
A good tablet for the price just need a bigger memory card,4.0
Quality of kindle is pretty okay. Just wish charge would last more than 2 hours when child is playing games after being fully charged.,4.0
Wanted a simple tablet and this ended up meeting our expectations.,4.0
Works exactly as I hoped and have had no issues. There is virtually every app you might need available to you.,4.0

"Great for accessing satellite radio, information searches, weather reports, etc.",4.0
Nice price drop to $139.00. Admittedly a device that makes your prime membership much more sticky but love accessing prime music through it,4.0
"These aren't the greatest batteries but they work. We've found that they work best in computer accessories like a keyboard or mouse but do not last long in things like toy remote controlled cars. Anything that takes a big drain in short bursts off of them (like electric toy car motors) shortens the life of these batteries fast but things that only use a small amount of energy over a long period of time do a lot better. Some name brand batteries do very well with high drain electronics and last a lot longer than these but if you use these Amazon batteries on low draw electronics you'll get your money's worth.What I've found them good for: Keyboard, mouse, laser pointer, small LED flashlights, small noise making toys (plays music, electronic beeps)Not good for: Anything with an electric motor, toy cars, pencil sharpener, etc...They can be a good value depending on what you use them to power.",4.0
This product works very well and represents an extremely useful piece of artificial intelligence.,4.0
I took a couple of pictures with the camera and when I went to view them I can't seem to find the pictures. When I bought my tablet they transferred what I had on my 7in but some of the apps didn't transfer. I'll have to come in and have it explained.Other than that I am very pleased with it.,4.0
this purchase was not for me but i decided ti purchase it for my wifeher name is rebecca.,4.0

Bought this for my grandson along with a case for his birthday. He loves it and all the apps available for a kid his age.,4.0
"They are good, esp for the price. We use them for remotes and stuff.",4.0
Good tablet for the money. Would purchase again. Very fast,4.0
"I personally like that it is relatively small and light in weight.So, easy to handle for my toddler.With the increased number of games and apps, downloaded on the Tablett, it slows down in speed. That, for sure, I dislike. But over al it is good to have when on the go, on car rides or long periods of waiting.",4.0
Good so far,4.0
"My oldest loves it, the charger doesn't last long.",4.0
Works great with hue lights and great speaker. Like the part where you can set alarms tell it to add items to your shopping list also just the weather news sports,4.0

Love it !!! Easy to use !!! Wonderful apps. Price was fantastic.,4.0
"Good value, never had one leak or go bad. Keep them in the refrigerator for longest life.",4.0
"Bought this for a bedroom TV. The interface is geared toward Amazon Prime members, so most of the items on the main screen are of no use to me. You must do some scrolling to get to the APPS page. So for people who aren't Prime members it's not as convenient as other streaming devices. My solution was to install Firestarter.I would have bought a Roku, but Amazon Fire is the only streaming device to support the TIVO app. So unless I wanted to spend quite a bit more for a Tivo Mini + Roku, this was my only choice. But after installing Firestarter, I'm satisfied. The Tivo app does not do everything a Tivo Mini does, it just allows us to watch recordings from our Tivo Bolt in the living room.Had it come stock with a display option to switch to a less prime-specific startup screen, i would have given it 5 stars. But Amazon is trying to promote Prime, so that's not going to happen.",4.0
"Size, brightness, and convenience are good. The option to link with android products for messages is a little hard.",4.0
The batteries are great and for the quantity and price it's a great buy.,4.0
"I bought this for my wife, this is her third Amazon Fire tablet. She mostly uses it for reading but she really likes the speed and the additional features on this one. She's very happy with it",4.0
Sometimes the screen is not as responsive as I would like it to be but it does what we need it to do and our daughter loves it.,4.0
For 35$ to get a reputed tablet is a no brainer. I am enjoying it!,4.0
The speaker on this unit really impressed me. It is as good as my little Bose bluetooth speaker. Super convenient to stream music from Amazon Prime. This product is a nice add on to those who are Amazon Prime members. I am looking forward to integrating it with more things.,4.0
4 stars only because its s e is bing. works great with arlo cameras,4.0
ideal for reading books just like a hard cover book,4.0
"Have you ever thought...make sure to add this (t.p., eggs, shampoo, whatever) to the grocery list? With Alexa, I can just say ""Echo (which is what we named ours), add shampoo to the shopping list"" Voila! It is added to the list, which is then accessible to both myself and my husband on the app we have on our phones. I don't have to stop what I have moved onto to find the list, something to write with..you get the picture. Same thing for the to do list. We also have it connected to lamps which is ideal for my Mother who is wheelchair bound and can't reach switches. She just says, ""Echo, turn on sofa lamp"" and Voila! the light is on.",4.0
"Once taking time to install google play store, It functioned as good as any other android tablet. The down side is camera which doesn't produce clear pictures.",4.0
"While these surely don't last as long as big brand batteries, they are a good substitute when your kids have 5000 toys that required 3-8 batteries a piece! They do the job and power those things up just as any other battery brand would.",4.0
"purchased for my sister for reading books, internet and games - perfect for beginners and novices. Easy to use. Would be a five if available with 4g",4.0
"Initially I purchased this solely for the purchase of controlling Lutron lights. However, after being @ a friends house for a BBQ and watching them use this for music, I decided to give it a try to see if it could replace my Sonos.It can't, however, I've found that I'm much more likely to play Spotify through this using voice controls if I'm in and out of a room for a shorter period of time and not near a Sonos to hit play/too busy to pull the phone out for Sonos app. This thing has also become more powerful as more IoT devices and services integrate with Echo or IFTTT. There is a TREMENDOUS amount of potential... give it a try and spend at least a week getting to know Alexa. You won't be sorry.",4.0
"Works great but the app store is nothing like that of Apple or Google. Fortunately, you can install many Android apps from 1Mobile. The screen is fabulous and it's great at its roots: making reading books fun.",4.0
Good for the price but whatever in quality I guess...don't last too long,4.0
I got this kindle after the kids had been at their grandma's around tons of iPads. They were just as happy with these...,4.0
We got two of these for our kids. They have put them down. Great price for kids!,4.0
"This is my review on AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48-Pack) from AmazonBasics. I love the value pack....Lots of batteries for a decent price.....I am always needing batteries for something so it's nice to have them on hand when you actually need them....These AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries don't last long. Yes, there are other brands that last longer but for the price it's a deal.....",4.0

My daughter just loves her new Kindle. It's so easy for her to use and there's plenty of free apps for her to play with To stay out of brothers hair.,4.0
It doesn't work good and it is very slow and that ability is not a good working tablet I would not recommend it,4.0
Love the lack of bells and whistles stuck in Airport battery lasts forever,4.0
This is a much better option than the Amazon Fire Stick. The picture quality is much better.,4.0
Tablet does everything I need it to. Only thing I don't like is how short the cord is.,4.0
"It's nice to be able to tell Alexa what you need from wherever in the house and the Echo takes care of it. Sports uodates, news, music, etc all with your voice. Very convenient.",4.0
"I looked at the math about the capacity and strength and longevity of different batteries and a lot of them are similar, including these, and these make the most sense price wise.I have tried HUNDREDS of rechargeable batteries and they get recharged a couple of times and then disappear. At a certain point they are just a waste of money.",4.0
"Alexa doesn't always know what you're talking about, but we love hearing her good morning quotes and anecdotes and the audio quality for listening to music is very nice - similar to a bose sound.",4.0
"I bought it for my wife to use mainly for news, music around the house.I have not tried the other automation features. I was expecting a little better audio sound but it s ok.Again I am using it at about 30% of capability, hence review is incomplete.But enough to give it a 4-star.",4.0
It has a bunch of cool features that other similar wireless speakers do not have.,4.0
"This tablet exceeded my expectations. Strong processor, nice screen. Wish it had Bluetooth and was not so centered around Amazon prime.",4.0
So far the Amazon Echo has been great especially at the discounted price. I'm still trying things with the Echo and I also have the Google Home and so far I'm giving the edge to the Amazon Echo as it looks like they have a head start on features.,4.0
Alexa has been amusing and informative to say the least. She is a wealth of information. She saves time and energy also.,4.0
"The only issue with this kindle is the price, otherwise, it's awesome. Light, compact, with a long battery life and tons of features... like an automatic backlight which is useful if you read at night.",4.0
It works well and you can do a lot of things on it.,4.0
I bought this for my daughter. She loves it! She uses it much more than her iPad for reading it's easier on the eyes.,4.0
This is perfect my kids to do their school work on and have fun as well.,4.0
"I got the Amazon Echo for my Parents. Since my Dad often ask us to look up things on our cell phones, I thought Alexa would be a great substitute in our absence. I love the easy setup and sound quality. My Dad is still learning how to navigate and at times gets frustrated with Alexa not having a response to his many questions. However keeping up with grocery list and Dr Appts are great for them. Amazon records what you ask which seems to pierce ones privacy. I'm sure it's for programming purposes since it's ever evolving, but beware what you ask Alexa because she'll remember.",4.0
"These Fire TV boxes are a bit bigger then the Fire stick but carry much more processing power and memory. There is virtually no lag when using the standard Fire apps, and only a small amount when using 3rd party apps (Kodi). There are tons of tutorial online to get the most out of your Fire TV.",4.0
I really enjoy reading on the new Kindle Voyage. Have had other Kindle models before this one. I especially like the brightness and lightness of it.Only drawback I needed to get use to was turning of pages being a little hesitant.,4.0
Works really well only wish it had larger memory for streaming better on slower network,4.0
"It probably does just as much as more expensive tablets and it's easy to use. The 7"" screen is a bit small but does make it easier to take anywhere.",4.0
"It's Light weight,... easy to read in any light level ... especially outside, which is a nice improvement from my last one.",4.0

"This is a good device. I initially bought the google home. I was very dissatisfied with it. I returned it and bought Amazon Echo. I am happy with it. I have had some difficulty a few times getting it to recognize my voice, but it is a very good unit. I am still learning what all it can do.",4.0

Bought this as a gift and the giftee really loves it!,4.0
Great item! As described and delivered fast. Would buy again!,4.0
"I was skeptical about the Fire OS, apart from being a Windows Phone user and then used Android a little on Nexus Tab, I found FIre OS a little annoying and not easy to use. But then just after 2-3 tries you get used to of and works fine. The tab is fast with Quad core processor and good RAM. I was thinking to install Android, I bought two of these so the one which I want to gift someone I'll install Android it, Although I myself will try FIre OS for a while and then decide.",4.0
"Looks like these will be good for lower drain, standby applications, where battery leakage is a concern. I have given up on the Costco brand as they tend to leak in these types of applications. While overall watt-hour density is average, still good for remotes, and common applications. It's hyped about Japanese technology, but not made in Japan.",4.0
I bought it for my mom after moving her into an assisted living place. . I was able to use it a little to show mom I was very happy with it. Seems fast and easy to use.i like it better than my phone . :) Didn't get a chance to see how camera was yet.,4.0
For the most part the Kindle 8 is a great deal for the money. The volume was giving me a problem but it was resolved quickly by Amazon. Overall quite happy,4.0
Great product and easy to set up. I have recommended it to others that have seen it in action.,4.0
No surprises with this purchase - Works well and am pleased with it...,4.0
Great eReader. The PagePress feature is so much better than swiping to turn pages. My only complaint is that I had to turn the auto adjust light feature off as it doesn't seem to reasonably adjust based on where I am reading.,4.0
"I like my Amazon fire-easy to use - user friendly.I liked the size - 8"" . It has made my life much easier since having hand surgery! Easy to check my email and other uses!",4.0

"Out of the box this is a very capable media streaming device able to stream from most all of the popular media streaming services, but once Kodi is side-loaded and configured it is unstoppable!",4.0

My child loves this tablet! He is on it all day long! Wish youtube was easier to use though.,4.0
"should have bought 2 at the sale price, fast, decent graphics great for reading ebooks best of fits in wife's purse",4.0
"Hard to use, No way to delete things from screen. Need better manual. most books are impossible if they are reference books.",4.0
"I got this on black friday for unbelievable price of $32. It doesn't have much space internally but with a sdhc card you can add up over 100 gigs.Amazon has its own browser and it was very easy to set up. If you want a decent tablet , that you don't expect too much from then this is it.",4.0
I love how this one lets you download apps. The picture quality is also a 4. I do find myself having to unplug it every 3 days to make it start over or it has trouble downloading. Especially with live tv apps. As for its competitors I'd say this is still the one to get. I find myself having a lot more options with this one. So my cons are minor. But still prevented me from a 5 star rating. I believe their next generation will be a 5 tho. Like I said. It's still the one with the most options available. Especially if you have prime. The best thing about Fire tv is it let's me download the direct tv app so I ditched my cable and just play live tv thru the app. It's the same tv and I pay over a $100 less a month now. It's worth it just for that.,4.0
good batteries!,4.0
"Performs as expected. An excellent value, especially for lose looking for a reasonably priced gift for techies...or for kids!",4.0
"If your familiar with Echo, you know what you're going to get. Alexa does not have all the answers however. Price is pretty much the same everywhere.",4.0
Worked just fine received in good shape,4.0
"Ebooks, audible and email, what else do you need? Great tablet!",4.0
"I bought two of these tablets, one for my daughter's graduation and one for me. I like the size, the sound and picture/movie quality of it. It was a great price and the option to choose different colors were nice.. I didn't give it 5 stars for the simple fact I can't get all of my important apps that I used on my android tablet, ex. one of my credit unions, favorite news station and a few others. Other than that, not too bad for the price and other features I named previously.",4.0
Easy to use. Enough apps for kids to enjoy for the price.,4.0
Does the trick. This is a good tablet for the price.,4.0
Seem to be working out as promised. I just purchased them within the lst month and used reviews of others to choose them.,4.0
"Mainly use it for playing music, was going to connect to Apple Music, but found it much easier to use amazon music and amazon offers a lower priced plan if you just use amazon music for Alexa. I have an outlet switch connected which is convenient for turning on/off lights. It has a good speaker for playing music. I think Alexa is comparable to Siri.",4.0
"I own the previous version, now, with this one, I 20 times happier! Everything works like a charm!.. I think I´ve never read so many book like now!",4.0
I am satisfied with my products. I look weekly for a good deal. I look forward to more deals,4.0
"There are a few things that Alexa just does not get, but I do believe a lot of it is user error on my part. She's great with playing my music, setting alarms and giving me scores to my teams. I still have to learn to be more fluid with the machine in order to get the best results. Nothing like saying, ""Alexa, can you ummmmmmm"" and it replies, ""WTH are you talking about?"" It really doesn't say that, but it might as well. The more I use it, the better I feel about the machine.",4.0
My granddaughter loves it. She is disabled and is actually learning her site words from school from the books app. Being ADHD she can sit for along time playing. Love that it is geared for kids.,4.0
"Capacity limit is my only gripe. Connects quickly and easily to wifi and remembers wifi passwords until you erase them. Books, many are free, especially the ones that you never read in High school. Check email, even works with Bluetooth keyboard. Cant be beat at the price.",4.0
"Price is right, but doesn't seem to hold as long of a charge as some of the other name brand batteries.",4.0
I bought this as a gift for a friend with a small child. The low cost of the tablet and general sturdiness of it made it ideal for her little one to play with and be entertained with the children's apps. Good tablet for day to day use.,4.0
Best buy ever for my 3 year old. Only purchased because they were out of the Galaxy tablet. I'm glad. This tablet is PERFECT for my 3 year old. I love that it has 2 modes. The kids mode sometimes freeze and takes a minutes for apps to open. Also didn't download Netflix movies like indicated. But regular mode works great. My daughter loves watching weird homemade youtube movies anyway.,4.0
"I like everything about the Voyage reader. It has a crisp display, is small and lightweight. I give it four stars instead of five because the screen light takes sometimes a while to adjust. The battery life is amazing. Prize could be a little less.",4.0
My wife enjoys this product. Really likes the grocery list feature.,4.0
good but they dont last for long time,4.0
I'm very accustomed to using verbal commands with my Samsung Galaxy... Same experience,4.0

Works well. Easy to use. Battery seems to be good. Would buy again.,4.0
Overall i like the tablet. However Amazon has set the lock screen with advertisements for their apps and books and you can't change that. I don't care about your ads Amazon!,4.0
At this price this is a fantastic product. Good for reading as well as watching movies whilst traveling.,4.0
"Great price, does the job. Used them to power BV Bicycle Light Set Super Bright 5 LED Headlight, 3 LED Taillight, Quick-Release. Gives very good light intensity, albeit first few uses. Can't yet vouch for how long these batteries last vs. Duracell.",4.0
We love this tablet for our 2 year old. She can operate it on her own and it has a great variety of educational and learning games for her. We love that it has skype capabilities but the volume for skype is very quiet. Overall great tablet for a first tablet for kids!!,4.0
Bought my husband this for Father's Day and he loves it! We even went back to get the smaller version for another area of our home and another for my father. I wish this hooked up to other Bluetooth items like the dot does,4.0
"I love my new Kindle. The size is perfect. It fits right in my purse. Easy to navigate and I love the touch screen. I am able to read outside without a glare. Only flaw is that it is not backlit, so in order to read in the dark I need a book light. I don't mind that so much, I just wish kindle would come out with a case for this Kindle with a built in book light like they did for the first generation Kindle.",4.0
Nice size works fine needs to weigh a little less.,4.0
pretty good batteries ---------would recommend energizer or duracell morethese batteries wear out quicker than others I've noticed,4.0
Bought on black friday sale. Good tablet for the price,4.0

"The Amazon Echo is very helpful and just plain FUN. I use it primarily for * Weather, * music on pandora, * ask simple questions. There is SO much more you can do with this...but I have only scratched the surface. It was very easy to install/connect to my home wi-fi - no issues here. The music audio quality is fine for a small device. It ""hears"" me very well - even from the other room. I would have given it 5 stars if it was able to answer more difficult/different questions using its internet search.",4.0

"Very functional for a tablet and e-reader. This was a purchase for my stepmom who broke her previous Kindle. She likes it because the screen is big, ease of use, and you can access the internet. The kids side is good too for the kids but some of the apps like YouTube and YouTube Kids will not play on this because it's an Amazon operating system. Overall I would recommend this to people who like the regular e-readers and want a tablet.",4.0

I already had a Fire but it didn't have enough storage space. This tablet solved that problem for me. However I'm unable to download Dropbox because it is already installed on my previous tablet and this tablet is a little different. I did however figure out that I could install One Drive and then put my photos into that program. Otherwise it is a good tablet.,4.0
Good product other than having to purchase additional apps for it to work.,4.0

"The Paperwhite makes it possible to condense a lot of books in one small device, thereby saving your house from looking like a warehouse. You can pack a lot of books into your suitcase with a Paperwhite. If your device gets stolen, lost or trashed, you may lose a substantial portion (or all) of your personal library. The Paper white allows you to increase size of print Big Advantage. Use of hand gestures to turn page allows faster reading. It's awkward to hold, lying in bed. An attachable gripper would be helpful to hold and read at same time",4.0

nice for this price................................,4.0
There's some fields I've notice that could use a power boost. I've been using it for about a month now and it gets slow at some points but for $40 I shouldn't complain,4.0
Overall its not bad. I like all that it offers I just wish it wasn't so finicky. You ask it a question and will say hmm i don't have the answer to that. And then ask it the same question again just slightly different it's is able to answer. None the less its a good buy.,4.0
"The Amazon Echo was easy to setup straight out of the box, and my family began using it immediately. We are learning new things it can do every week. The sound quality is amazing, and this has become the primary music source for my house. When purchasing, I would have preferred a black Echo, but white is all this Best Buy had at the time (before Xmas), but white looks very clean on our kitchen counter where it sits. There are some words Alexa is still struggling with understanding, but we do have a bit of a Texas drawl, so I think we're getting used to each other.",4.0

I love the Amazon Tap. The sound is great and it's completely portable. It lacks the convenience of touch free voice command but it cost less to compensate. Excellent product for the money!,4.0
I bought this product for my grandmother since she has a hard time reading the small print in books. The Kindle Paperwhite has a large font setting that has made reading much easier for her and the matte screen provides for minimized glare. She can now easily read a book again!,4.0

"LEDs run thru these so fast man. But, I'm lazy and amazon delivers so I keep buying them. Don't have a time sheet. But I have one of those harbour freight free with purchase lights and it seemed to last 5 hours before I noticed it was dim. So that's good I guess as its still very bright, just not new, never been used bright.Usually I replace 1 out the 3 batteries every 3 weeks. But I work on a bike and car, and have never had any LED go out or get unusable dim during a job with a fresh change.",4.0

"We searched for months, wanting to cut our cable bill. Bought the Amazon Fire TV box. Amazon has their own programming and is adding more all the time. Also, downloaded a bunch of apps, and have been watching TED talks non-stop. Also bought an HD antenna for local channels, of which we get about 45. Deprogrammed the foreign language, shopping, preachers, and still left with about 35 which offer the 5 main broadcasters, and a LOT of 50s-70s repeats.",4.0
More powerful then it's little brother. No hesitation at all. Love the fact that I can run a network cable to it instead of using wifi.,4.0
At first I had Amazon Fire stick but I had too many problems with the screen freezing. Having some memory solved the problem. My router is in the basement 2 floors down. My only gripe is I haven't found a way to organize apps or shows like Apple TV. Got this so I could get PS Vue. Now I have programming I like in addition to Amazon Prime programming. I do get concerned with the possible data usage fees that major internet providers keep trying to impose. Otherwise I'm happy with the device.,4.0

Other than that this is a great product.",4.0
I bought this for my parents to be more connected into Facebook messenger (they don't have phones) and video calling.

"Very satisfied with the product, I have one for each of my kids now and for that the price point is amazing. I have a pretty big beef with best buys in store customer service at this point, I ordered a different color to help keep my kids kindles separated between them. The color I ordered for my 6 year old came in but they sent the 16 gig rather than the 8 gig. Instead of GIVING me the color my 6 year old ordered the customer service agent behind the counter absolutely INSISTED that they couldn't do that and canceled the order making me take one of the colors we already had and at least temporarily disappointing my 6 year old son who did not get the color he had wanted. Very very dissatisfied with best buy customer service on this and this insadent will make me question some of my future purchases with best buy.",4.0

Good basic tablet for home and the kids. The only downside is that a credit/ debit card is required to link to the Amazon store even if you download a free app. I'm able to let the kids use apps and the Internet. I can limit the sites the kids can visit and apps they can use.,4.0

Great investment. I wouldn't rely on them in a high powered devices (even though I haven't tried them in anything other than computer mice and remote controllers) but I still have 90 of the batteries even after half a year of lying around. Great investment on batteries for when you need them.,4.0
I bought this tablet to replace another one that had died. it works of my purposes but one thing to note this is an Amazon device and does not have google play services installed. all apps come from amazon market.,4.0

"So far I've had my Fire Tablet for over a month. Its my first tablet. The lack of the Googlke Play store means the Amazon apps are pretty limited, but I found avway around that. The front camera is grainy but acceptance while using Skype. Battery doesn't last long, and it seems to take hours to recharge. For a $50 first tablet, I suppose those are acceptable flaws. Feels robust in the hand, though the plastic casing reminds you of its materials if you hold it tight.",4.0

"Purchased the Amazon Fide HD8 as a gift for my dad, who has been overjoyed with it. The display looks great and it offers him access to many of the features he looks for in a tablet, from e-books, streaming video or online shopping.

Very pleased with the product and performance. Easy and fast to download content - such as movies and music. Took on a recent trip and now wished I had bought one sooner - fits right in back pocket of my DSLR camera bag. Only draw back was unexplained power loss - as described by other reviewers. After a day it came right back on - suggest it might be a recharging problem as after a full charge it is working fine again. For the price and content available - great buy.,4.0

"This is a great tablet. I got it on Black Friday at an amazing price. The downside: a lot of features are only available to Amazon prime and audible members with an expensive membership fee and the selection of apps is limited. But on the other hand it‚Äôs inexpensive, the Alexa app is useful, games run ok, the display and photo quality is good and it‚Äôs easy to handle. For music and books I recommend an additional memory card - I use a 128GB - which works fine.",4.0

"I love the Echo...tells me the weather, makes my shopping list, and plays music as I request. I didn't give it an excellent rating because products like this can always be improved on, but it's definitely a must have in your home and for the price, you can't beat it!",4.0
"This tablet is a great price and perfect for kids, however the picture quality could be better",4.0
Got this tab for my 3 year old daughter. Shes always on my phone or tablet so got her her very own. It has all the functions and apps she likes and uses not to hard to use and gets the job done for the right price. She is 3 so she will drop and be rough with the tablet seems sturdy enough and not expensive that it's going to break the bank if she damages it,4.0
"I like the amazon echo, but it needs more improvements. It does not understand many things you ask. it does not connect to all my wemo devices however, it is good at what it does. the sound quality is the best it offers. I like the local weather and 7 day weather and news. With my amazon prime, my music is played and sounds great. Some might say it is too high a price to pay, however i bought it for 150.00 barely used and glad i purchased it.",4.0
We got these tablets for our 4 year old and 9 year old and they love it.,4.0
"I was worried that it would have lag, but it didn't. I got this to replace my Kindle paperwhite (Which I still LOVE), because I wanted to be able to listen to the audio on the books as well. IT's a great little tablet that does so much of what I wanted it to do. The stand by time and play time are better than I thought they would be as well. I LOVE the blue light filter, although that takes time to get used to it if your not already accustomed to that sort of thing. The only other thing I really don't care for is the fact you can not easily add Google play store.",4.0

"You have to purchase the power outlets, light switches, and other things for Alexa to communicate with. Once you do and setup them up, it works pretty well. You have to be careful if you put it near the TV where they might do a commercial or a story about it on the news, Alexa has pretty good hearing and perks up when she hears her name. Over all, easy to set up with the app and works pretty well. Takes some time getting used to asking Alexa to turn on or off the lights and not just reaching for the light switch.",4.0
"The speed the great. The Kindle Fire has a lot of apps to choose from and has not frozed on me yet. Once you figure out the Parental Control, it works great with unwanted charges.",4.0
"Counting back, this is my 5th Kindle since they came out. I've never had to replace one that ""died"", but sometimes I want the newer features. This one is to replace the older ""books only"" unit that is starting to be un-cooperative that I take to work for reading during lunch. I'd have probably just gotten another ""reading only"" unit, like a paperwhite, but these were less expensive.Pluses, can carry movies, music, etc, like my Kindle HD Fire. Can easily let me shop on Amazon, can access free ""underground"" apps, (i really don't need it for games though), and it is simple to use.Minus, uses power quickly, like the Kindle Fire HD, I have to charge it daily to every other day. I set a password (VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED), to prevent unauthorized uses or purchases. It has given me minor problems with books by marking that I was on a different page than where I stopped, and it ""links"" to the other Kindles and they go to that page as well. For some reason, accessories, like cases are more expensive. If you want to store a good deal more, you require an SD chip, ($11 for 32 GB).",4.0
"We love to go to the beach and the wife loves to read when we are lounging around. Great graphics, even in the direct sunlight. Simple to download books and the battery life is very good",4.0

"WISH the kindle fire (for kids) had better way to limit how many items you can download at once. Most kids do not understand that clicking on a bunch of pictures will download that game/program, which is CLOG download times. Needs a better way to remove unwanted items, rather than clicking.. and clicking on every item. Speed and performance is pretty good for a tablet. App store is great and has many items.",4.0
"I am happy with the Fire given the price I paid. As reviews stated, the camera is not very good. Would like it better if it could mirror to a smart TV. Otherwise, for the value it is a good product.",4.0

"Got for my 8 year old. The parental controls are nice. I wish the netflix app was registered as ""video"", so I could give him 30 minutes of games and 30 minutes of video. I'm sure this works with purchased videos, maybe prime, but not netflix. He Star Wars Commander, netflix, and reads books. It's a good size for little hands. It's great that as the parent, I can buy a book or game, and all devices can use it, even with each other if it's a multiplayer game. I bought a cheap case elsewhere that also props it up for hands-free video watching.",4.0
Very good access to multiple venues. Cheap and easy to use.,4.0
It is everything it promised. I use it to download books.,4.0
"So far we are very much enjoying the product. Great for outdoor use by the pool due to its portability. We have not had a chance to really test how long it can go without a charge but a couple hours has been no problem. Only catch is that you cannot stream a single Spotify account on more than one device at the same time, so if you find yourself purchasing the Dot or Echo you will not be able to stream using the same account at the same time.",4.0
This is a nice little tablet and Great for the kids,4.0
I purchased two of these tablets to replace all the other brands that stopped working within a two month period. So far so good! It's a perfect fit for my two younger children. And I feel you can't beat the price for a Fire. I have control on what they access. The only downfall is the micro usb socket within the unit is loose. When charging I have to fiddle with the plug to ensure it stays in the unit.,4.0
I bought the first one with some issues but brought it back to best buy and they exchanged it. It works great and my kids love it.,4.0
"You get the most out of this if you have prime. Prime music is great with this, you may want to expand the memory with a card though.",4.0
This is the 3rd fire in my family. This one was for my mother in law. The other two are my wife and my kids. These are easy to use and work well with Amazon as you would expect. I would recommend them as a starter tablet. I have used both Apple and Galaxy tabs and this one fits in well.,4.0
Great inexpensive,4.0
"I have an old Kindle Touch, the last one that still had text-to-voice, which no longer works. I decided to upgrade, started reading the reviews, was enticed by the The Kindle Voyage and took the plunge. The Voyage is pretty and sleek, with neat features, and I enjoyed using it for a few days, but my frugal self just couldn't justify the price difference between it and the PaperWhite. While the ambient light sensor was nice, I often ended up just adjusting it manually because it was still a little bright in a completely dark room. I made more errors of turning a page than I meant to with the ""page turn"" because of where the page turn spots are located, plus, I'm in the habit of flipping pages on the phone or a tablet, so I kept swiping despite the availability of page turn. However, the clarity of the screen, the quality of the light, the form factor, the weight and the way it felt in my hand while reading were all very nice. Nonetheless, the price difference bothered me enough to return it and get the Paperwhite. The thing I miss most about the Voyage is the quality of the light, and how even the lighting is on it. The unit I had did not have blank spots or a yellowish top half of the page, or any of the lighting issues some reviewers mentioned with the Voyage. I purchased the newest model of the Paperwhite and I like it, but the lighting appears pretty dingy. However, it's only when they're compared side-to-side that I wished I wasn't so cost conscious. If money is not an object, I'd say get the Kindle Voyage, if it is, the Paperwhite is a fine little reader, and overall I'm happy I have it.",4.0
I purchased this so that I could use Skype to check on my dogs during the day. I had to download an app that makes the Fire stay on otherwise it goes to sleep. Once I had that app installed and Skype doing the Auto-Answer it worked well. Overall if I was going to use this as a reader or mini tablet it looks like a good product. The screen is bright and sharp.,4.0

"Pros: - A beefy machine for the price;- Great battery management in standby.- a solidly built android tab at a rock bottom price. Cons:- Proprietory Amazon user interface may be irritating but this is a personal preference- The app selection is limiting. But you can install google play and get all you need from there. - Brightness and resolution may not be the greatest but completely usable - a compromise for the low price- had some wi-fi issues on several occasions (compatibility issues?). It is a little weak, also-7"" may be a bit small and aspect ratio is a bit weird (long an narrow)Overall, a reasonable tab that does the job done (not many games, though) for a minimal investment",4.0
I got this for my grandson and he just loves it! Durable and easy to manage.,4.0
Okay new look is less appealing but seems to work okay,4.0
"When I ran out of AA batteries, I of course came to Amazon to purchase more. As I am on a tight budget, I decided to go with the AmazonBasics brand. When they arrived, I immediately replaced the batteries in my Xbox controller. I noticed that the batteries did not last as long as the more popular name brands. (i.e. Duracell, Energizer, etc.) This is the only reason I have rated the product with 4 stars instead of 5. Everything else about these batteries is great. I am getting low already and will probably order them again.",4.0

"If you like to read books, I totally recommend this product. I love reading books and the kindle paperwhite really helps. I used to read books on the iPad all the time but it would strain my eyes. After reading all the reviews I decided it was finally time to get a ereader. Since I had my iPad already I just needed one to strictly read books, so I got the paperwhite. It is so nice to read from especially in the sun. It's almost like reading from the actual book. It's the perfect size to read in one hand and stores so many books, even some for my child. It's also great for traveling. I have all my books on hand no matter where I go.  There are only two cons to the paperwhite. One is that the touch screen is not that receptive as compared to an iPad. At times it doesn't register my swipes or taps. The other con is that it's only black and white. It really isn't a problem when I'm reading, just for the children's books.",4.0
"This isn't the best tablet, but for casual gaming, youtubing, the price was perfect for this tablet on black friday.",4.0
I purchased a Galaxy phone and received the Fire tablet for free. I do use it to read books to my son. He mostly uses it to play his games. It does the job!,4.0
"Runs awesome for a good amount of time. Unfortunately sometimes the device disconnects or asks to be refreshed, during that time the remote does not work and it is frozen on that screen. Other than that it runs very fast and is a great unit. The fix for that is unplugging and replugging.",4.0

"Or at least a future I'd like to be living in :-)Lets get this straight. As a Prime member, you can get this for 99. At that rate, think of it as:- A wireless speaker that you can just issue spoken instructions to!- An alarm clock that you can shout at (Alexa! Shut up!) in the morning, and it will obey you :) (its my half asleep morning power trip)- Set a timer for when you're cooking- Fact check your friend while you argue with them :PSo my common use cases aside, here's what is good about Echo:- Speech recognition works *really* well, esp for brief phrases.- It can hear you from pretty much anywhere in the room, and is pretty accurate with the wake word (I've been using Alexa)- As a music player, its really nice to be able to just ask for a song by name and have it just come up, without having to hunt through a playlist, connect to the bluetooth speaker etc.- Purchasing music is pretty seamless. (As if Amazon needed another way to get you to spend money:-) )- iHeart radio integration, if you're into that kinda thingHere is what is not so great:- Speech recognition for longer phrases needs a couple of attempts, maybe because of my accent. (e.g. Alexa, play the song The Troubles by U2- As a music player, its a bit lacking in bass.- Sometimes, while its playing music, you have to use the wake word once or twice to gets its attention- Bing search Really *rolls eyes*I'd love to see in the future:- Integration with Fire TV, so that I can simply say Alexa, play The Sopranos on my TV- Google search- Being able to send a message to a friend in my contacts Alexa, message XYZ blah blah blahOverall, its a pretty cool product, and I'd love to see what it looks like over time!",4.0

"Overall we enjoy our new Echo tower. The speaker is not the same quality as our Sonos or Bose speakers but the convenience of being able to ask Alexa to play a song or find a style of music or tell you the weather or traffic as you are running out the door make up for the quality. The kids love asking her to rap or tell a joke. I look forward to syncing Alexa to more of our IoT items to make controls ""hands free"".",4.0

The echo is good at playing music and getting the weather. I've not tried it with other smart home devices. It would be great if it were more intuitive. I found each app requires a specific command. Problem is trying to remember the app and allowable voice commands. Glad to see more abilities being added constantly.,4.0

"I bought this device because my Fire HDX wasn't adequate for reading in direct sunlight. For sunlight reading, I give the Paperwhite a 5. However... I cannot change the display time before the screen sleeps, the reading location jumps backward and forward a lot when I touch the screen (when I thought I was just going one page either way), the home screen is confusing and not user friendly (only 3 books visible on ""show specials"" model) and the battery only lasts one day if I read 5 or 6 hours.

"It is the right size to throw into a purse because it is light weighteasy set up.

Great price and easy to set up. Already read 4 books on my new fire. Graphics quality is pretty good too.,4.0
Got this for my daughter when it was on sale. She really likes it. It seems to be slow charging but the battery lasts a long time.,4.0
"Works well, gives a to of additional options for home television entertainment for everyone.",4.0
"I bought two of these - one for each of my kids. Though they aren't super powerful devices, the price point is a perfect trade-off for the little ones. Now they each have something they can spend their screen time on, and they are wonderful for trips. The software is a bit clunky, but overall, a great device for $50.",4.0
"They seem to work well. I've only used three of the pack thus far, but that item is still going strong.",4.0
"Would give it a 5 star if the battery lasted as long as they claim. But it's worth the extra charging times for the nice design. So light and easy in your hand especially without the cover. But, using the cover is comfortable as well. The leather cover smells a bit when it arrives but I let it air out for a few days before using it and now it's fine. Nice quality leather and I love the merlot color. The page turn buttons are easier to use than the buttons on the voyage. Screen looks the same even though they claim there are more backlights on this one. I'm very happy with my Oasis.",4.0
"Okay, so I have been debating for days on whether to rate this thing 3 or 4 stars, and I still want to rate it 3 and a half, but I have settled for 4 stars. Here is why.PROSThe only real reason I wanted this case over the others is because every other case holds the Kindle in with straps around the edges, and this is the only case that holds the Kindle in while letting you see the whole front side. It holds it in perfectly, neither feeling loose or too tight to get it out. The black leather is genuine leather and smells nice, and while the front cover is very thin (if you tap on it you get a hollow drum sound, and it can be bent without much effort) it takes mild amounts of abuse without a problem. Also, the flap folds back perfectly and when you are reading, you hardly notice the Kindle has a case on.CONSMy main complaint is the quality of the leather. If you compare this to the case for the Kindle 3 (keyboard) the leather is a little thinner but much less durable. I sometimes lightly hold my Kindle between my teeth when I run out of hands, and after a week I can still see my tooth marks (whereas on the K3 case I couldn't). Also, even a mild scratch will either take several days to disappear. UPDATE: Most scratches will mostly disappear so its not as big a problem as I originally thought.The only other complaint is of course the lack of anything to hold the cover closed, but this has actually not been much of a problem for me. Quite often I like to frisbee toss my Kindle onto a nearby soft surface (like carpet or a pillow or bed) and I was afraid the cover would flap open every time, but 10 times out of the 11 I tried it stayed shut just fine.Read more",4.0
Overall a good First Tablet for a Child. I find it difficult to find a specific game on the Child User. The Adult User has a search feature. Not sure where the Search feature is on the Child User. My 5 yr old Grandson is enjoying the Tablet.,4.0

Great for my 12 year old for games and the like. Spending $15 at Amazon to remove ads is worth it. Don't like that you have to turn on tracking from some of the free games from the Amazon store.,4.0
"The Amazon Fire tablet its self I give a 4, I thought it had the Google Play Store on it and the kids couldn't find the games & stuff they wanted But my youngest loves it! Walking him through the whole process ( after the other kids tried it out I did a system restore back to factory settings) I liked it and so did my son! So all in all I think 4 Fits well!",4.0
Tablet good for kids and some adults. Price and screen resolution were also a selling point.,4.0

Don't last very long but good quality for the price.,4.0
"It's 35-50 bucks, there is no better tablet for that price range, toss in prime and it's even better!",4.0
"Great but needs more work to be worth the money. Very limited in what can be asked in a form of questions. You have to continually down load skills in order to ask questions related to topics this is very taxing and spending time doing it makes you just say, ""forget it"". Hopefully this will be fixed soon. Really should have purchased the Google one but oh well.....",4.0
"I am definitely happy with my purchase. It's a very good android box, even if most of the content seems to be amazon content with the ability to sideload (install other android apps not from the amazon store) this makes one of the top android boxes. Also the ability to play some games makes it a plus. (just buy a microsd card since memory is limited to 8GB on this box)",4.0
"Got this for one of our employees. Works well and you can see the print well. Good point is that it's small and compact. Bad point is that it's small and compact. Easy to carry around, but more difficult to see words. Works great, though! Great price too!",4.0

"This kindle is awesome. I love the design of it. Nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way it's designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read.

They were very good,4.0
"The Echo is a great speaker with clear sound that reaches from one room to another. The biggest problem that I have had us getting it to work with the Nest thermostat. The thermostat must be registered under the same email account as the echo, otherwise the Echo cannot remotely control it.",4.0
Good price for a commodity item that is used around the house. Quantity is just enough so you have batteries on hand yet few enough to keep the stock fresh.,4.0
"I purchased two of these tablets, for my 10 and 11 year old daughters. They work great! Very good deal for the price.",4.0
This is perfect. I carry mine 24/7. Super fast also. Only downside is the battery life is not good. I have to charge at least once a week no matter how I use the settings/light level.,4.0
You can absolutely not beat a Kindle fire. Unless you are my 7 year old son. Haha. But seriously at the price and the beatings they take they are worth it every time and with the cloud storage I don't even mind having to replace it every year.,4.0

"Purchased this on sale for my son. He and I use the tablet to watch movies, play games, read books, and browse the Internet. It's great for the price we paid.

I use my kindle for reading only. I don't care for the internet part of it so I don't use it for internet purposes at all.,4.0
"This is a very basic, functional backpack that does the job that it when designed for. Unlike other, more expensive models, this one does not have the feel or look of something that you would show off to your friends. However, it holds my 16 laptop quite well and has enough pockets to contain all of my usual travel gear. The material seems to be fairly durable but it makes a crinkly sound when touched or moved. This would be a good choice for a teenager who is hard on his belongings.",4.0

Its a good product in the basic range. Not that fast to work on.,4.0
I like it its good for the kids to play with and easy to use.,4.0

We bought the tablet for our kid and it actually is good for her.,4.0
We got these for my kids for Christmas and they absolutely love them. All I did was set up a free time account for them to play and watch videos. Best part is that's all they can do so I don't have to worry about them going anywhere off limits.,4.0
I will start off with the fact that I like paper books a lot. I bought the e reader because it's light and can travel with multiple books. The interface is fairly easy to use and it holds a lot of books. The automatic light feature doesn't work as nicely as I would. Overall I am happy with the purchase but there are features that could make it a 5.,4.0

"I love to read but I rarely have time these days. For those who do have the time, this is a great device because you can take it anywhere and read it easily in pretty much any lighting situation. The text is crisp and easy to see but I wish the screen was just a little bigger. I ultimately took this back and went with a Kindle Fire HD 8. The pros of a tablet outweighed the cons for my situation, but the Kindle Paperwhite is still a great option for people who read a lot and want to read their books anywhere they go.",4.0

Wag glad I purchased the Amazon Echo. Easy to set up and link with the two iPads in our home. Use it to play music from ITunes as well as the IPad.

Heartily recommend it to my friends and family.,4.0
it is good so far. will update again if need to.,4.0
"The accuracy it has understanding the words is really good and clear. small thing I didn't like is to make her higher to max volume, you need to repeat it like 7 to 10 times; also in max volume is you must be really close to it so it could listen to you.

Easy to navigate. Great for kids and adults. Parental control features. Love a tablet and EReader in one!,4.0
The Fire HD 8 was a replacement for my grandsons Samsung tab 7. I was pleasantly surprised how nice this tablet is for the price.

"These batteries are good, last long, but are temperamental. My electric trash can opens on a motion sensor. It worked great with the batteries for about a month, but then the trash can couldn't draw enough power in order to raise the lid. Then another week rolls by and the trash can works fine. I don't know if its the batteries or the trash can, but Im assuming its the batteries. Other than that, they work fine in everything else.",4.0
If you like to read and like to have more than one option then an e-reader is something to consider. I like the screen when reader as it is not glaring like a tablet or computer screen. The ability to adjust the font size is very beneficial for me. I also like being able to highlight words and get their definition. I am not a fan of all of the controls but once you get use to them the Kindle is very useful. I wish I could convert PDFs to the Kindle format a little better but that is not a fault of the device.,4.0
Got a great deal. I don't think I'd spend more than $100 on it. Works well with xm though.,4.0

"I bought this tablet on sale when it was $30! For the price it's excellent! Does everything as expected and a nice bonus is the fact that the screen resolution is very nice and clear.

My requirement for this tablet was reading kindle ebooks and watching Netflix. I don't play games and no need of browsing on the table too. Bought it tablet on BF for $35 and found it to be a good value for reading.

"BestBuy was offering some discounts during Thanksgiving and this prompted me to buy. I was not an avid before and just casually bought this product. But I must admit, I am not at all disappointed with this. Works best with English books, does not work that well with native books. Also, this product is not backlit and does not have any option to increase the screen brightness and I would deduct 1 star for that. You need to install another product called Calibre in your computer to convert books to Kindle readable format (mobi). Kindle can also read PDF, but mobi format is better readable compared to Kindle.",4.0

Overall a Best Buy!",4.0
Only reason I was not able to rate this five of five is that the app 3m cloud library is not yet compatible so getting books from the library requires an older app which does not work as well.,4.0

This is a fun device for listening to music and getting news updates. I thought it would have a bit more functionality but I think I need to explore apps that it works with and I am sure more will be coming but for the price point the speaker alone is worth it.,4.0
"Very easy to use/navigate. User-friendly interface. Only con is that it's a bit sluggish for the avid user, which was just improved in the 3rd generation of the Fire Stick (better processor).",4.0
So far so good. Batteries last. Only issue I have had is the wrap around the batteries are a hair thicker than normal which makes them a very tight fit compared to others. I had a few ripp bc they didn't fit,4.0

"Works great! I bought 2, 1 for the kitchen and 1 for master bath.",4.0
"I have an iPad that I read books on. Unfortunately it's horrible to read on the beach, park or anywhere outdoors in sunlight. The kindle paperwhite is perfect for that.",4.0
I picked this one up to replace an older one that had stopped working. I like the back lite and it's not a bad size.,4.0
Great device. Works great and so far no issues. :),4.0
My sons nook battery was going out this cost less than just replacing the battery and is highly recommended by family members,4.0
I got this because it was much cheaper than the iPad and it supports flash. The bonus comes with the ability to binge on my Netflix series and listen to music.,4.0
Excellent resolution and speed. I love the easy usability of the new fire.,4.0
We have one at home to we thought it would be fun to have at the office to place music. However you can only stream 1 Alexa per music account which is annoying. They should have a subscription package like Netflix that allows more then one device to stream for a higher cost per month if needed.,4.0
I purchased this because have become a cord cutter and this was highly recommended by a good friend as a worthy streaming box. I was pleasantly how fast and responsive it is and future proof with the added 4K functionality. Only downside is that it has a tremendous amount of amazon bloatware which I understand but it is constantly present.,4.0
This is a good product for the price easy for kids to use,4.0

This product is very good to use .I recommend for my friends.Very easy to use,4.0
These are better for kids instead of those fancy and costly kid tablets if you set these up with right content they need. Resolution is not great though. You get what you pay for.,4.0
"The first tablet I bought was good at first until it stops charging. I went to best buy to check it and they said that everything is okay. We tried it again at home and it was the same thing, it charged for a few min until probably 2% and will stop. I brought it back to the store and they replace it with a new one. So far I don't have problem with it as well as the other 2 tablets that I bought together with the first tablet.",4.0
"It is so nice to have all these streaming services in one box, and the voice command feature works great! Smooth UI with no lag, especially compared to it's little brother, the Fire Stick. My only complaint is that there is no 4K Resolution support.",4.0
"Christmas gift so it's to early to tell, arrived on time",4.0
bought both the echo dot and the echo home the tech responds to commands from everyone in the house including the kids but the echo search engine needs a lot of work,4.0
"If you want a tablet that is current and works well with the android platform and that you won't have a coronary when you kid drops on the floor, in the toilet, or anywhere then this is for you. We have 4 total and Amazon service if you have any issues is second to none. They even replaced previous ones for free when the charging port got loose but it seems that is now a problem of the past.",4.0
I give these tablets away for prizes in our redemption store. Always sell out and a great value.,4.0
"My daughter uses this and loves it. The only complaint she had was she cannot get games from the google store because it will only allow game and app downloads from the Amazon store and Amazon does not have all the games. But as far as working, it does what it is supposed to.",4.0
"Bought this for my 87 year old grandmother who wanted to be able to play games and read books from the library. My aunt lives with her and can help her use it so its perfect for that type of user. After playing with It, I would consider it for just about anyone other than a hardcore user that wants the latest and greatest tech. if you are tech saavy, you can do more with these Fire tablets than advertised.",4.0
"Good capabilities good sound, quick responses. Good amount of applications which respond quickly.",4.0
"good batteries for the price. great for remotes and clocks, last a little less in cameras. still a great value for the price!",4.0
"I bought this unit because I needed a portable bluetooth speaker. When it was on sale, I figured why not get Alexa with it. It works well. I plan to use it when I am overseas in my hotel. We'll see how that goes.",4.0
Seems ok but not what i really needed. I'm not much of a reader,4.0
"This feels like an affordable tablet. While not the best in class, it isn't priced to be that either. Works well. Happy with purchase.",4.0
I like the flexibility and great responsiveness of the FireTV. Our family is able take advantage of the built in options (including Amazon Prime) and set it up just the way I like. I also have friends who prefer the Fire Stick. They have customized those and still have good performance. FireTV is great for anyone and even better if you are a little tech savvy..,4.0
"This is a great product, that doesn't have a lot of distraction for kids. Great little reader for the price",4.0
"This kindle is great for reading books. Which is exactly what it's designed for. Very crisp text in bright daylight or complete darkness. It feels good in your hands (weight is balance, it doesn't feel flimsy either). Quick page transitions when reading. Don't expect it to compete with tablets in the app or visuals departments, because that's not what it's meant to be used for. Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the touch screen tends to be a little picky at times.",4.0
"Fun gadget. Plays songs, various entertainment, still learning all it can do",4.0
very easy to use and the battery life is execellent,4.0
Easy to install. Easy set up. Would recommend to friends.,4.0
"I have owned Kindle's for many years and have always been very happy with their portability, performance and ease of use. The highly expandable memory is what lead me to purchase this Kindle for my son. There are only two areas that I am very disappointed: the first, in the parental control settings, in order to ensure that my son cannot make endless one-touch purchases (and I mean one-easy little touch) I must set the controls either off or on. The problem with this is that he then has no internet access, or extremely limited access, so limited that he cannot access content I normally allow him to access...big problem. Now Amazon is pretty good about refunding unintended app purchases, there is a cancel button, but then you must wait days or more for the refund to be credited. This is an issue that I am getting more frustrated with as we move through time with this purchase. The second issue, Amazon's Kindle app store is weak. If you can find some of the apps that you are searching for they may not be entirely supported by the device, such as Facebook....a major app and a major downfall to Kindle use. Because of this last issue both my son and I have Apple devices to supplement what we cannot do on our Kindle. All this being said however, My son and I both very much enjoy what the Kindle's do have to offer, so they get a GOOD rating because of this....however because of the issues I discussed it was difficult to choose between an AVERAGE and GOOD rating.",4.0
I decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and I do not regret my decision at all!The only con (for those evaluating this as a tablet) is that Amazon has their own App Store. Many apps from GooglePlay/AppStore are simply not available.,4.0
This is my first e-reader. I didn't know about the odd refresh and it took a little while to get used to but I do love how small and light it is and that I do not have to remember to plug it in everyday,4.0
"Easy to setup, battery lasts for as long as needed. You can do all the basics that a higher end tablet does and is reasonably priced..",4.0
I have been using Kindle for several years now but my old one was starting to freeze and had problems connecting to the internet sometimes. This new one is a great replacement. I like that it is backlit and that it syncs to the latest page read with the Kindle app on my iphone. Great purchase.,4.0
I bought the item for my goddaughter and she loves. Easy to use and durable. Reasonable price and great features,4.0
This was a gift to an employee and they absolutely love it.,4.0

Easy for a 5 year old to learn.. the apps on the Tablet are very good.,4.0

Simple to operate for a 3 yr old . Would recommend,4.0
My kids love itBeats buying a galaxy tab that's double the price and compariable in my opinion.,4.0
Alexa runs my entire house. The Echo show is a great addition to the Echo family. Everyone needs one!,4.0
"It is highly recommended for someone who loves reading. Easy set up, lots of books to download.I have iPad, but this beats reading experience hands down.One downside is that the new Kindle Paperwhite has lower battery life compared to it's previous generation. Hence only 4 star.",4.0
Love this gift for my dad he couldn't get it charged fast enough to play his poker games! Great price & so worth his smile on his face!,4.0
"They're a decent value for the amount of batteries (especially on Prime Day) you get. I use them mainly in remotes around the house and other devices, and I haven't had any issues with them leaking. They do drain a little faster than Duracell coppertops, but these are a far better value when caught on sale. I've used both the AA and AAA and they're both decent.",4.0
I thinj its a but overpriced. If i knew better would have opted for the flash,4.0
"I had trouble deciding between the regular kindle and the Paperwhite because I read at night. It was a great decision, because when I turn the light all the way down, I can't read at night. It's lightweight and sturdy. My only complaint is the speed of switching between books and the strange flicker with the page turn. It's not a show stopper, because it is so much better than trying to read on my iPad mini.",4.0
We bought this as a gift for a family friend. She uses it all the time for Netflix. She is really happy with it.,4.0
"I did get this on sale right before the holidays. I was looking for a Kindle with at a minimum back lighting. Though it doesn't solve all of the glare issues, it actually made for a great tablet at a very low cost price.",4.0
"That's my only issue with it, vs the last one. But it was bought for a living room tv that does not use it so no biggie. Easy to install Kodi on. Just wish they would decode VC-1 files smoothly. Maybe the next gen?",4.0
"A little slow loading compared to my HDX which just had the screen broken, so needed a less expensive replacement. Great for reading books of course!",4.0
"Great tablet for toddlers. Easy yet fun. I purchased two tablets for my grandkids, ages 2 and 4. They both love it and enjoy playing with it.",4.0
This product really helped my father in law hear and have conversations with his daughter who's voice is a higher pitch.,4.0
"They're batteries that work for an average amount of time, nothing much else to say",4.0
"Decent, but have to reset monthly, i have to unplug and at times re enter my pass cause this freezes or stops completely. You can add KODI though. i would still but one for living rm though.",4.0
worth the price you pay for the product. thank you,4.0
"Whether you need the weather, information about something, a recipe or even just music, the Echo is right there to help. I haven't even used a third of the ability of the Echo but am very impressed with what I have used.",4.0
I bought this device to use with children in my therapy practice. It is taking me awhile to figure out how to set it up and organize it. IT 'took over' and set up things with Amazon I did not approve such as charging my account and registering me with Prime before I could figure out the settings. The picture quality for the screen is beautiful but the camera photos are very pixelated.,4.0
This device is amazingly! I got one as a gift and knew I had to gift one back!! So glad I no longer have to shuffle through my music! I can just ask Alexa and the song is played!! Great product!! 10**********,4.0

This is a good tablet for my son to use to play his games.,4.0
"I had resisted a kindle for years and finally gave in for travel. Yes, I am one of ""those"" who love books! Surprisingly, I really like the paper white kindle. It is easy to read & works well in most lighting situations. There are two things that keep me from loving it. 1) I really wish it had the option of reading the book out loud. 2) I thought it would be a lot cheaper to get books for the kindle. It may be a little cheaper but not a lot. You would think that without the cost of paper, etc, that savings would be passed on to the customer. Since they don't, I tuck it away until I travel.",4.0
"This device is a nice starter tablet for kids. The Fire OS with Freetime Unlimited (free for 1 year) is an excellent environment. The warranty is great, and had we kept the device I'm sure we would have had the opportunity to use it. However, the device we received in the ""Kids Edition"" box was not registered as a ""Kids Edition"" with Amazon, thus the FreetimeUnlimited plan only lasted 30 days and the ""Kids Edition"" warranty did not apply. Amazon could not register the Fire as a ""Kids Edition"" so it was returned.",4.0
Enjoy the product. It works well. The whole family likes to use it.,4.0
Doesn't do much yet not enough skills to learn just yet,4.0
"This is a good product, value for money. It has everything one can expect in low price tablet.",4.0

"My mouse still works with a battery, otherwise I don't think I use them for anything else. ok batteries",4.0
Durable tablet that has a nice size screen for kids. Can download plenty of apps and reading material.,4.0
I was using this for a while it was 10X faster then my kindle 5th generation yes 1gb of ram but the App Store made from Amazon is not the best so I downloaded the google play store to get the apps I mostly used I only use my kindle fire had 8 for books and reading or watching YouTube or the web I'm giving the rating 4 stars,4.0
"The kindle fire is great. I bought one for my husband when the old kindle quite working, then I bought one for my daughter to replace the iPod she lost. She loves it. I love that you can add extra storage with a mini SD card (something you cannot do on apple devices).",4.0
"Good for the price but--while I am not sure--it seems a few were duds. Even so, the price point beats the field.",4.0
very fast n nice ui but controller quality not great! dropped onced n middle part now rattles but the app controller works great and all apps n games are quick,4.0
"The idea behind this is great, but the technology might not be there yet. I've had some issues with dialog from TV shows setting it off.",4.0
Great product! Easy setup and easy navigation. Recommended,4.0

"I got this for my wife since she broke her old one. She only uses it for reading and playing games but she seems happy with it. I've used it a couple of times, considering its price, I would say it's a pretty good tablet.",4.0
Excellent product and makes reading books very easy. Very light and allows you to have access to numerous books on the go. The E-paper display makes reading really enjoyable and does not suffer from glare and the harsh back light from the displays on phones and tablets,4.0
Very good tablet for kids. I bought a few and gifted them to kids of my relatives,4.0
You need to find the correct way to ask questions or you will not get good answers. Otherwise I like this item,4.0

Good phone but my return visit the customer service was horrific,4.0
Only small issue was setting up to start with. My kid took care of that.,4.0
Worth the price. Very light and love that it's personal,4.0
Work well at a great price point.,4.0
"So far I only see one flaw that bothers me, no volume control built into the remote, the device is very fast, easy to setup and use, though it does offer prime video stud right up front, but a couple pushes of a button and your on to your Netflix or hulu or what have you, works great with plex as well.",4.0
"Work well for the most part. One pack had defective batteries, but the rest so far have been fine. Last decently long.",4.0
overall its ok just make sure you have a memory card if you have a lot of apps,4.0

"This kindle is the 7th one in our house. This was a purchase for my youngest son who is ASD (high functioning, but still has meltdowns when things aren‚Äôt done correctly) and this was to help us travel. Made it through with only one big meltdown. The kindle certainly helped.",4.0
"Although sonos speaker sounds better, this is not bad, and at a cheaper price. Soon it is reported Alexa will be able to control your sonos system as well.It also includes voice control and provides 'skills' which allow for home automation possibilities. In my mind well worth the price for the voice controlled audio features, and has potential for many other uses!",4.0
It was a gift for a friend and she loves it. Would definitely recommend it,4.0
This is a great little tablet for the younger generation.,4.0
"I had been looking for a smaller tablet. The new Fire HD8 is the perfect fit. It's great for media of all types. It's even a pretty good gaming device. But keep your expectations in check. It won't do everything a full laptop can, but it's not supposed to. The screen is terrific, although you may need to download an app for white balance adjustment.",4.0
"I know not everyone wants to read a direct comparison to an Apple TV rather than a review on the moerits of this device, but I have owned both and stuck with the Apple TV instead of this.The Apps I used (DirecTV Now, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video) choked and buffered much more often, or froze completely. The wifi reception was also sub par.The remote is good, and I prefer the batteries approach to Apple's rechargeable one. Everything else though, the Apple TV seemed to do better.My two cents. Still a solid streaming device, and the price is better than Apple's. I would make the decision based on how plugged into Amazon's ecosystem you are vs. Apple's.",4.0
I use this tablet as an e-reader and to listen to prime music at the same time. Great for this.Still leaning other features.,4.0
Its exactly what I am wanted and the price was fair,4.0
I would highly recommend this product. It's speaker is very good and you can ask it a lot of question s and she will usually have the answer.,4.0
This was a gift from my wife. I wanted a lighter Kindle and this is it. I have been happy with this new version.,4.0
I like this device a lot. Very good battery life and like the fact this is linked to my Amazon account for books and music.,4.0
The screen really does add tremendous value. The bugs are almost all worked out and the quality of hearing my commands is night and day from a month ago.,4.0
This box is on par or better than the competition when combine with Amazon Prime. 4 stars because I feel it's time the internals get an upgrade.,4.0
"I bought this Kindle 7"" fire for my granddaughter. She has used my fiire HDX and was used to the format, so it is working out great for her. Still I wanted something inexpensive in case anything destructive happened I would not have much money involved. We are very happy with it.",4.0
"I would buy it again and have twice over already. I actually bought the kids fire kindle and bought this for my wife, her's was lost and she borrowed my sons kid fire kindle I ended up buying her this again, and would buy it again. I would recommend buying a sd card it fills up fast without out it but it is a lot cheaper to buy the lower GB kindle and then buy a good sd card.",4.0
I think it's good for a first tablet. i m use to the Ipad so this is taking some getting use to.,4.0
Easy to use but would like more apps to use with looking food to connect to home devises,4.0
Great inexpensive option for kids for continually break electronics.,4.0
I have looked at getting a Kindle for over a year and have looked at the specs and also other tablets. I enjoy reading and when traveling have to pack 4-6 books when I cruise. I decided to get the Kindle Fire - great price and get it a try. I love it and will someday upgrade to a larger model. Have read 5 books all ready and have 30 more waiting to be read. Great one to start using an ereader.,4.0
"Great phone for any level of android user, starting from a beginner to an advanced root user, camera can be better though",4.0
"it's a bit flimsy, but does stand up, so I'm not complaining...",4.0

"Got it home, was able to set it up in a few minutes.",4.0
Easy to use. Great for someone who wants to play some games and use simple apps.,4.0

"We bought this for our 3 year old daughter. Great variety of apps, books, and educational videos for her to explore. Love the features that allow us to control her time spent on it. My only complaint is that its processing speed is quite slow getting between different menus but at this price and for a 3-year old I can't complain too much.",4.0
Enjoy using but sometimes Alexa struggles with answering questions. Nice to have not a must have. Definitely room for improvement.,4.0
It was for my mother in law and she loves the tablet.,4.0

Bought these for my children they love the camera on them. The last one they had didn't have s camera,4.0
Over all my kids love their tablets. I would've given 5 but the fact that it doesn't have a lock to the app store I took off 1,4.0

"I waited to get this keyboard until I did a little bit of research, and I think that made all the difference. In the time it took me to do the research, Amazon had pushed out an update that fixed the Bluetooth problem the keyboard had been having. A lot of the one-star reviews are from people who bought the keyboard when this problem hadn't been solved yet.The keyboard itself has all the keys you'd expect: alphanumeric keys, up, down, left and right keys, and a few extra, like keys for the volume and a Home key that actually takes you to the carousel screen. However, there are a few curious omissions:1) No Page Up or Page Down2) No Delete key. (There's a Backspace key, but that's not the same thing.)The keys are well-spaced and it's not a problem touch typing on the keyboard. It's certainly not as spacious as a full-sized keyboard, but it's about the size of a keyboard on a smallish laptop.The one thing they could add that might make this keyboard close to perfect is a way to carry it. It's a perfect portable size, but it's not something I would want to store in a backpack. I will probably keep the box it came in for travel purposes.",4.0

This is a great tablet for the price. The Amazon OS is a bit sluggish but this is great for kids or to just keep laying around the house.,4.0
"Very easy to use. Kids love it! Only downsides are lack of certain apps, and the speakers are weak. All in all, a great tablet for under $100",4.0
"the screen flush with the sides is great. The glass feeling is really nice. I don't use the side buttons for page turning but only because of habit. They are great and the need for pressure allows me to hold the kindle without changing pages. But, the price is painful. It is a splurge purchase since the paperwhite is just about as good in nearly every respect.",4.0
"excellent new piece of technology. if done again, i would have just bought the DOT(without the speaker). then bought a decent speaker and aux jacked it. speaker not worth $125 more. but its pretty awesome.",4.0

Is limited. Does not play your own playlist? Is ok.,4.0
I bought the Echo based on a suggestion from a relative... it's got some nice features and the 'easter eggs' are fun to find. Sometimes I feel like I have to yell at it for the Echo to hear me and there's a large amount of stuff that it doesn't know (Amazon is working on that). I would definitely recommend getting a Dot as well if you are placing the Echo more than 5 feet from where you'd normally be talking to it from.,4.0
My Kindle Fire is much better than my previous Kindle. Works well in bright day light and user friendly. Access to books and downloading is more streamlined with this device. I'd not hesitate to buy again for myself or as a gift.,4.0

Nice tablet... the only downsize I see is you don't have the play store... so apps are limited,4.0
"The Echo is a great product, it was easy to set up and Alexa was answering questions in no time. There are several basic functions that the Echo is wonderful at: news, weather, music, time and timing. I love playing the Jeopardy game. I think that if I have anything to say on the ""down side"" it is that I had a higher expectation of the product's ability to search the internet for answers to some of my questions. Lots of my inquiries come back with the answer ""I did not understand that question"" or ""I'm sorry, I do not know the answer."" These are only a minor irritation/amusement. Overall, I am pleased with the product. Hopefully I will grow in my knowledge of the product and Echo will also grow in abilities through upgrades.",4.0
As promised.,4.0
"This tablet is really good, very much user friendly.",4.0
I have about every single streaming player on the market. This one is not better or worse than the others. I got it only for using 3rd party apps. For that it works flawlessly! If you need a streaming device this one will fit the bill.,4.0

My daughter loves her tablet. I couldn't have made a better purchase.,4.0

"This has been a fun and intuitive way to play music, get the weather report, find out game scores, etc. I'm looking forward to integrating it into my house with lighting and temperature control. The speaker sound quality is excellent for such a small machine.",4.0
"The Amazon Fire TV box hooks to cable modem easily and is very user-friendly. Great for Amazon Prime members. The only issue is that there is not enough 4K content out there and, in my opinion, does not warrant the price as opposed to the more portable Amazon Fire TV stick. Yes, the box has a faster processor and more RAM than the stick, but for content, I've had NO PROBLEM with the stick and it's cheaper.",4.0
Decent batteries price wise but don't seem to last as long as the name brand batteries and I assume these are actually some lower end name brand batteries that Amazon has their name stuck on them.,4.0
"I like the price, so far they seem to be just as good as the other brands.",4.0
This is a great tablet for the price and is easy for my kids to use they love it,4.0

"I absolutely love this tablet! I love the price compared to other tablets on the market. Plus the display looks great! At first I was a bit skeptical about how it ran, or if it was any good, but I actually read a personal review about The Amazon Fire and it seemed like the person had a great time using it.

"I had the original kindle fire for ten years and I loved it. But it broke on me and I decided on this one after looking at all the upgrades from the original. It let's you do so much more, but some of the tutorials (like for the internet) weren't helpful.",4.0
We are enjoying it so far. We really like the fact that you can play games one it. I would definitely recommend.,4.0
I bought 2 one for each one of my daughters and they both like them.,4.0
"I was giving the tablet as a gift for Christmas to a 3 year old. I initially purchased the ""standard version"" but returned it for the kid version which included a ""Bumper box"" as well as a 2 year warranty, which the standard version did not have. Thankfully, I asked the parent of the child if it was OK for me to set it up prior to giving it to the child. The set up took some time. I was thankful that I read the reviews because I bought an additional memory card since the product only has 8GB of storage. The child was able to open the gift and ""play"" immediately as a result of doing up-front work. One thing I noted that when the child played a movie through Netflix, the resolution was not very good. Could be an adjustment needed in the tablet, which has yet to be worked out. I would recommend this, but if giving as a gift for a child, I would recommend doing the up-front work so it is ready to go for the child when they receive it.",4.0
Still working on getting to explore all the features.,4.0
I got this for my daughter's for Christmas this is a great gift it helps them learn and keep them out of trouble thanks again Best Buy.,4.0

Great price and with a name like Amazon I feel these are going to be good. I bought for my daughter because I gave her something that she needed 27 (yes!) batteries for. Great value and plan on getting again if they work like I think they will. Only a 4 star rating because I don't know how long they'll last. So far so good,4.0
Seems good,5.0
My only frustration is that you can't use a flash drive to view video or photos without purchasing a app that may or may not work. Other than that the product is awesome!,5.0
"In my search for a wireless speaker, I looked at various models and decided on this one because of the portability, the look and how it synced with Alexa.

Definitely would recommend!",5.0
I have an Amazon Echo and the Amazon Tap works wonderfully with Echo. The sound quality is great. It is easy to use and set up. It beats turning on the receiver for music. If you are looking for great and easy sound machine the Tap is it.,5.0

"I had been looking at the echo for awhile but wasn't an early adopter. As much as I geek out over products like this I wanted to wait till the skills library was a bit more tested and expanded. Well imagine my surprise when I got this as a gift! Absolutely love using my Echo/Alexa. Weather, music, shopping lists, and the constant things they are adding. Yes it has its moments when it can't understand something but I do tend to mumble at times. Don't expect it to be a search engine giving multile results to an inquiry but it's a great speaker, home assistant, kitchen helper with measurements, and it even controls my home temperature on my Honeywell thermostat. Next purchase...smart plugs so I can turn some items off and on with my voice. Love the interactivity and I haven't even scratched the surface yet on all Alexa has to offer. I have found the Love my Echo website to discover new things I haven't tried yet.",5.0

"Did a good bit of research for the fire tv. Bought the stick first, had several operating issues. Unit would buffer then freeze up. The unit got real hot. Returned the stick for the fire tv box.

Bought for daughter taking American Lit class that requires alot of reading. She downloaded audio form and enjoys having those stories read to her while working out.,5.0
"We already have an echo so I didn't think we needed the tap and procrastinated getting it. Now we use it everyday -- mostly to stream Amazon prime, TuneIn, or Pandora channels.It is funny how the latest technology sometimes brings us back to where we were when I was a kid -- having a ""beat box"" to carry around room to room and outside. We use the tap as a 2016 version of a ""beat box"" that is much smaller, rechargeable, and way easier to tune! And with side benefits of controlling our lights, HVAC, and with Alexa onboard ready to answer the random trivia questions.The sound quality could be a bit better, but surprisingly good. Adjusting the volume isn't as easy as it should be. The battery lasts a long time and its a snap to use a bluetooth speaker as well.",5.0

The only thing I wish would be that the charging cable supplied had the wall plug to go with the USB cable.",5.0
Surpassed my expectations it charges faster than the one that comes with kindle fire when new. So I would purchase another if I ever need a new one.,5.0
I love my kindle fire it holds a library of books that I can read anywhere. I change from my kindle fire to my phone if I don't have the kindle with me.

Can you make bad batteries in 2017,5.0
I bought this primarily to be used as a Kindle eReader and this is a good product for this cost.. The only drawback is that I cannot access all the apps available on the Google PlayStore and have to be content with what is available on the Amazon app store.,5.0
Bought these for laser tag guns I purchased for my sons birthday (each requires 4) and they have literally played all night and morning and they are still going strong. I've bought much more expensive brand name batteries that haven't lasted this long. For the price I'm very pleased with this purchase!,5.0
Bought for friend so could have face time with grandbaby.,5.0
"I love it, all you have to do is to talk to it. I have another system I don't use just for no look for the remote. The bad thing with the Echo is that sometimes can understand what we are asking, but even that is fun.",5.0
Great response and quick navigation on this device make it a pleasure to use. Software updates frequently keeping your device up to date. Fire tv is extremely user friendly with a nice layout.,5.0

These are cheap and seem to last as long as any other battery I've tried. I'm seriously impressed with the amount of batteries I get. For the same price I could get 16 of my usual brand. This will be my go-to from now on.,5.0
I love it when Amazon brings out commonly used products under their own name that perform well and are priced right. These AAA batteries are just another example of Amazon's buying power and smart branding. Because why would any company put their name (and reputation) on a product if they weren't convinced that it would be a true value to consumers The last thing that they want consumers to do is identify Amazon with anything but quality.So buy these knowing that they are a good value and work properly. And if for some reason you get a bad batch--which can happen to anyone--simply return them under their return policy and get a replacement box.,5.0
This is the box you want for 4k. If not get the regular stick.,5.0

Works as advertised. easy to use and easy to read.,5.0
"my 2 year old daughter loves this tablet! I witnessed her drop it once (off the couch to laminate floor) nothing I can tell was affected. I was a little reluctant to buy this for such a young child, but with the way we seem to rely on technology these days, plus the cost, I just had to buy it. my favorite feature is the parental controls that allow me to set times ...not just times that it can be used but for certain content as well! I can set the tablet so when my older kids (10 and 8) log in, they need to complete educational tasks for an allotted amount of time before free play... and the whole thing logs out after a certain time so I don't have to go searching for it in their rooms at night :) great tablet, glad I got the bumper too, great price",5.0

"I absolutely love this tablet. I check my e-mail. I watch movies. The only thing I DO NOT like about the tablet is that it sometimes have problems taking you to the correct site. But you must remember that it is a tablet, NOT an computer. I find all in all the picture is clear and the sound is wonderful also it has unlimited cloud storage which is good and when you download a picture it takes just a few minutes. Amazon Prime is a must however or you will be spending a lot of money to view movies and read books as almost everything available cost money. Prime is a money saver and it lasts a full year. It also comes with free shipping. I tried it and it is good. I receive my purchases in 2 days. Prime is the way to go if you purchase this tablet because it comes with a lot of perks.",5.0

"The Tap offers all of the conveniences of Amazon's Alexa in a battery powered portable bluetooth speaker. It has a hands free option, it works well both as a way to take Alexa on the road and as your primary Alexa device at home., the Tap doesn't sound as good as other Bluetooth speakers in its price range. It's not waterproof and Alexa doesn't work at all without Wi-Fi. but still pretty cool and heaper than the Echo.",5.0
I like the paperwhite as it was very easy to read while sitting on the beach in bright sunlight,5.0
Echo or Alexa from Amazon is smart and learns along with you. She is a nice gift for teens as well as seniors. It's the kind of thing you might think you didn't want or need until you get it and begin to use it. We like the sound quality of the speaker.,5.0
Looks like a real book! It's amazing! It doesn't last weeks like it says maybe a little over a week but I don't mind charging my electronics. It's really nice especially if you have kindle unlimited! I would recommend for people who like to read on the go!,5.0

"After struggling to read books for the last several years, my husband suggested getting an e-reader. I never wanted one, because I previously enjoyed the feel of a real book in my hands. He was pretty convincing, so I went online and researched a few different ones. I settled on this one, after reading so many great reviews. I wanted the Voyage initially, just because it had page turn buttons, but I opted to save some money, and the page turning with the touch screen is incredible, I don't think I'd use the buttons, even if I had them. I am already halfway through my first book, and I've had this less than 24 hours. I'm a very slow reader, so this is impressive! I tried it in the sun, and it was extremely easy to read- no glare. I also used it while working out today- it's very easy to adjust the font to make it easier to read. I am so in love with this, and am so happy we bought it! I am excited to get back into reading, and to have thousands of books at my fingertips!",5.0

"As an avid book reader, I have always loved having an actual book. I was very reluctant to get a Kindle at first. However, It has been such a surprise. It's very light weight and thus easier to hold then a traditional book. You can easily download new books at the click of a button. There are daily and monthly deals you can take advantage of for a fraction of the cost of a regular book. The viewing experience is superb because you can change fonts and size and increase or decrease background lighting, making it very easy to read in any light. If I don't know a word I can automatically look up the definition or add highlights or notes. Plus, I can carry an entire library with me where ever I go. I actually read way more now than I ever did before. I am extremely impressed with this device and it's more than exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend it to anyone.",5.0

"Amazon Echo Plus is a fun product it requires time to explore its skills. It copes well with accents, however the Echo have to be placed as center as possible to get the best listening results. It is a great first step towards a smart home but there are more accessories required to connect the house together. If you live outside of US you may find some of the features limited at the moment. Hopefully this will change with time and also more skills will be available for local services.",5.0

The unit does a good job of playing music from Amazon music. It hears your voice very good although it gets confused at times when I tell it to turn on a particular lamp and I have to slowly pronunciate it. Like that the music shows the lyrics.

"In the past I have avoided tablets at such a low price point, and while I was skeptical of this one as well it has been a great purchase. I use it for tasks I would normally do on my phone such as web browsing, streaming videos, reading, and Android games. It performs all of these tasks admirably. Battery is great as well. I can get up to 7-8 hours depending on the task at hand. It is small enough to always have with me (typing this review on it now), yet large enough to give that real tablet feel as opposed to my phone. I have already purchased another for a friend. At this price you cannot go wrong!",5.0

I was pretty impressed with this little device. It was easy to setup and works rather well. I had also bought a IPad Air 2 with 128GB during BF for $375. After playing around with the HD Fire I returned the Air 2 because it met my needs at a much lower price. I added a 64GB SD card and am downloading movies from Netflix. The HD display is very clear. Battery life could be a little better but overall I'm very satisfied with it. The free stuff you get with an Amazon Prime account is icing on the cake. I dig it!,5.0

The Fire HD Tablet is portable and very easy to use. It can be held in one hand.

The screen is only slightly pixelated compared to other models due to its price point. I would recommend to others.,5.0

A nice tablet for the money. I use the Fire as a secondary tablet to by iPad but I find I use it as much as the iPad. Great for traveling because of its size. I am happy with the purchase.

"As of this writing, I've been using these for over a year and have yet to experience any problems or issues related to dead batteries or battery life.I use a battery tester, and randomly measured a few, new, out of the box, and they all rated at 100. Happy with these batteries.",5.0
I can't buy enough of these batteries. I bought but the AAA and AA AmazonBasics batteries. I always buy batteries around Christmas for all the toys and devices everyone gets. This year was no exception for batteries. The only thing that surprised me was that this was the first year I needed more AAA then AA batteries. As the year continues to have more demand for batteries and try to keep a good stock in case of emergencies. The AmazonBasics batteries have been working great. They last as long if not longer than the other brands and they cost less. Even coupon clipping and waiting for sales hasn't beaten the price Amazon has been offering. I have made a number of purchases for Amazon batteries already and will continue to make more purchases in the future especially around Christmas again.,5.0

I had a fire stick and decided to upgrade this so I can connect my internet straight to it and get higher speeds. It runs fast less buggy and I plan on buying another for upstairs bedroom.,5.0

The Amazon echo is worth it just for playing music. You can play pandora or Amazon prime music. But it's much more from setting a timer to adding items to my shopping list. Alexa answers your questions better than any device. And totally hands free,5.0
I bought this to keep up with my email while my computer being repaired . the computer is fixed and still use this more than the computer. Love it!,5.0
This is cheap and best and working very good for the price,5.0

"Just as good as Duracell, if not better. Do you beg to differ Here is an experiment to conduct for a school child. Use a Duracell and an Amazon to light up two light bulbs and see how long each one stays lit. Then divide: (hours lit)/(cost of battery) and see which one is the better value. I already changed out one Amazon AA in my wireless mouse and another 2 AA batteries in my wireless weather station. The mouse Amazon AA lasted about a month and a half and the weather station is still running after 3 weeks. The batteries came wrapped in packs of 4.",5.0

"Amazon products amaze me for the value of what they are. This is no different. A great little 7 inch tablet where you can surf the web, watch movies, read books, or listen to music. Only really works if you have Amazon Prime. This really unlocks the potential. To really unlock the potential you can also subscribe to kindle reading unlimited if you read a lot or have several people in the family that will also read. I actually opted to return this one to upgrade to the Fire HD8 which was only about $20 more at the time and gives you a slightly bigger screen and HD resolution (I love to stream movies).",5.0
Decent speed and a nice screen make this a great device for the money. I find myself using it more and more.,5.0
Purchased for my 75 year old mom so she could adjust the font size and find the books for her book club less expensively,5.0

Easy to use wide variety of functions awesome price,5.0
Out at the farm we set up a ClearStream 4 antenna and got about twice as many channels that we wanted to watch (total about 50). We needed an interface for streaming and this works great. In addition it gives us a remote control for our Tablo to record the shows with no subscriptions needed. Total cord cutting!,5.0
I love amazons batteries. Always there to save the day. I use subscribe and save to make sure my kids are never without batteries. It helps so much.,5.0

Weather forecasts, ""who's that actor that was in...."", set an alarm for a reminder, add items to shopping list, trivia questions-you name it, Alexa does it. Tell her goodnight, and she responds kindly with goodnight. Been on the fence for awhile about purchasing this and now I am so glad I went for it",5.0
The device is one of the best especially if you are an Amazon Prime subscriber. The Amazon Prime Music on the FireTV is the best music streaming device. The only issue I had is that the remote controler stopped working and I had to use the firetv app on my phone to control the device.,5.0

The packaging is awesome. Very easy to store.,5.0
Very pleased with these batteries as I ordered both these and triple A's and was amazed at the life of these batteries. will absolutely reorder as needed.,5.0
"I am 100% an apple person. I was always hating on Kindles due to them having a very limited AppStore. Once I found out how to get the google play store on the device, I fell in love. The kid version is 100% worth the extra money. It isn‚Äôt just the case that makes it more money, it comes with a year of freetime, which features awesome child appropriate shows, videos and apps. It also includes the two year worry free warranty! It is the only type of tablet I will be purchasing in the future. With iPads, you‚Äôre constantly terrified of them being dropped and cracking. Even if these crack, at least you have the warranty with no ridiculous deductible!",5.0

"These are your standard AA batteries that are very similar to most other AA batteries you will find at most stores. The energy output is quite similar however the price on Amazon is a lot cheaper than what you can find in the store. For that reason I really like using these batteries from Amazon Basics. They are cheap and they last an acceptable amount of time for a cheap battery.Dimensions and close-ups can be seen in the photos I have attached to the review.Included in this set are 48 batteries that are shrink wrapped in groups of 4.Pros:*Good amount of power output*Last an acceptable amount of time*Awesome priceCons:*NoneAdditional Considerations:These batteries are not rechargeable. They are one-time use. If you need a rechargeable battery you will need to look elsewhere.Overall: 5/5 stars (.5 rounds up, .5 rounds down) 5 starsIf you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and I will get back to you as soon as possible.",5.0
"What a pleasure. This unit is lighter, faster and has more capability than my old Kindle Fire.

The fire tv is great for streaming movies and playing games on,5.0
"This is my second Kindle (the first one lasted several years). I enjoy the ability to read in the dark without background light. The backlight works very well and does not have the eye strain that a tablet may have. With the touch surface, I find it a little too sensitive and have accidentally moved several pages. The side page turn works very well. Much easier to travel with this unit than a large book.",5.0
"Looking for a present for that young professional or graduate, this is great. They love technology.",5.0
Great product!! A good product for the price!! Great battery life,5.0
Easy to play and very helpful to learning for children's,5.0
"I love it, it is easy to read on and a nice size screen for the kids to watch movies on",5.0
"For the low cost what's not to like. Be careful what/how much you load into the limited memory. An excellent entertainment tool especially when powered with PRIME. Screen (movies & Tv) display excellent. I recommend a ""glass"" screen protector. Helps greatly manage finger smudge. EZ to setup. EZ to use. EZ on your wallet.",5.0
"Lot of good batteries at a good price. Can you find CHEAPER batteries Yes but they're of worse quality. Can you find BETTER batteries Yes but it'll cost you. Both of those other options have their own usage scenarios, but these are a great middle ground that works in most average cases.",5.0
"Kindle Oasis is phenomenal... It is portable size so it fits almost anywhere when I travel, the book-like screen doesn't bother my eyes after long periods of time of reading, I can modify the font and size to my wants and needs, you can conveniently connect to your Goodreads account to view your bookshelves and all of my purchases sync perfectly. The color Merlot is beautiful and I've had it for three months and traveled with it and there have been no damages. The battery life is so long I have only charged it three times since owning it and I read anywhere from 3-5 hours a day. Completely user friendly.",5.0

"Love the shopping list feature, weather report, time, listening to favorite music.",5.0
"I had an original Kindle DX and a Kindle keyboard. I decided to upgrade and get the Paperwhite and I'm glad I did. The light is great for reading where it isn't very bright. The e-ink is great for reading outdoors or anywhere. It's easier on the eyes than reading on my Ipad. I still read physical books too, but the Paperwhite is great for traveling and just tucking in my purse to take everywhere. I recommend it to anyone who likes to read.",5.0
Works exactly as expected. I bought this in an effort to convert my old flatscreen with no smart capabilities into a smart tv. Definitely got the job done!,5.0

The echo has been a lot of fun and really adds to the convenience of my day.,5.0
"I bought 2 fires for older friends. 55-60 years old. They run jw library app on it. It has never given them any problems. I used the tablets before I gave them to my friends and they seemed reliable and plenty fast. A nice simple tablet, and the best price. A good intro to a tablet",5.0

"I bought myself a kindle earlier this summer and love it so much that I decided to get one for my ten year old. I thought she was spending too much time engaging in mindless activities on her phone and computer and thought this might be a good alternative. She has responded surprisingly well. One feature that I really like is the dictionary. If she comes across a word she doesn't know or can't read, she can tap on it, and the dictionary will pop up defining the word. This enables her to use her inference skills to decode the word or understand the meaning better. This has been a nice addition to her bedtime routine.",5.0

"Amazon echo better known as Alexa is much more than a smart speaker. To unlock its true music potential, one should have amazon prime. Great at understanding basic questions, Alexa will also give you news briefs and play music via amazon, Pandora and Spotify membership. The true joy of Alexa is its home automation commands via smartthings, hue, nest, etc. Highly recommended for those seeking more than just a smart speaker with decent mono sound.",5.0
The kindle is the best ebook reader. I love it and use it daily.,5.0

"These are just AA batteries and I really can't get excited about them. But here's the reason I'm giving them 5 stars. I had typically been buying Kirkland brand AA batteries at Costco. The Kirkland batteries come loose in this large cardboard packaging with a plastic tray thing to hold the batteries. The packaging of these batteries, wrapped in 4 packs in a little cardboard container, is so much nicer for storage than the Kirkland batteries. The packaging alone compared to what I've been dealing with makes this a 5 star product in my mind.",5.0
I love how Alexa can control almost all smart things and help control lights and power on and off devices to help us get ready for the day. The music is connected directly to Amazon Prime Music and I love how the sound is clear and crisp. You can call out to Alexa from far away and she‚Äôll add items to your shopping list and the Alexa app is so simple to view the lists and control your smart things.,5.0

"I love that Alexa can be controlled without having to press any buttons. She has a decent amount of range that she can hear your commands from. It does take some timing to get used to her, but soon enough, you'll being to reap all the benefits of an Amazon Echo. Currently I have two Wemo plugs and Phillips Hue lightbulbs set up to my Echo and plan on adding more Alexa-compatible smart devices. I love how easy and seamless it is to get all my devices working off Alexa. It's also a bluetooth speaker and can get very loud.

I highly recommended it to everyone that comes in my home and love to show what she can do.",5.0

"Great deal- don't waste any more money buying batteries at the store! You can't beat the price and they work and lask as well as brand name batterys. It it amazing how much cheaper these are- and you get twice as many. I got these in AA, AAA, C and D. The main reason I even bought them was when I was looking for flashlight batteries- size D for my trusty maglight (yes they are heavy but I love them for it, they are perfect for a car and the weight keeps it steady if you have to put it down) and size C for a different flashlight. Of course I needed an odd number and couldn't believe how expensive they were in the store. I checked Amazon- had no clue amazon had their own batteries and noticed that in all of the sizes- the price was less then the smallest pack of that size in the store and had twice as many batteries. Did I need this many AAA batteries at the time- nope but let me tell you I'm so glad I got extra- less than a week after buying them I had already nearly used every one. I went around the house and replaced every remote and device I could find and they work great! With AA and AAA size I'd recommend buying a bigger pack- yes it does seem like a lot of batteries at first but trust me you'll be glad you got extra- it's one of those items every house needs and easily gets overlooked.",5.0

I have had a few kindle's in the past so this was nothing new for me but what I loved about this one is that the screen is big so when I am reading a book it's a lot easier than when I had the first kindle screen.

"I am a believer of streaming TV, especially with the cost of Comcast bills continually going up. I like the fact that I can watch what I want when I want. When you look at what you pay Comcast and AT & T for TV, it makes more sense to look into these Amazon devices in which I have 3 now.. I've personally turned in all of my DVR's to Comcast. I went from $182 to $98 a month. That's almost half. I have the Comcast package just above Basic with internet Blast. Also, if you look on the internet, you'll find ways to get free channels with this device. I'm saving money and have access to more things to watch now. What more could you ask for.",5.0

I love it and I'm I'm not using even a quarter of Alexa's capabilities. The thing that I love the most so far is the shopping list feature. If I take something out of the fridge that I need to restock I just ask Alexa to add it to my shopping list then its on my phone when I go to the store! no stopping in the middle of a recipe to find my phone to add the item. Also works great with Pandora radio. If a song that I don't know is playing and I want to know the name and artist I can either ask Alexa or look at the app on my phone.

"I was a bit worried that I wouldn't like the tablet. I had watched the prices go up and down on Amazon. I wish I had bought one when they were $29.99. I also read all of the reviews and watched video reviews. I had a trip coming up that I didn't want to take my laptop on and took the plunge. I was glad that I did. I was able to watch Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go (HBO Now) and YouTube with no problems. It is a great tablet for the price. I also have some books loaded to read later.

"I purchased this to replace my first gen Paperwhite. The shadows on the bottom of the Paperwhite always bothered me. I decided to upgrade to the Voyage and it is much better. I like the physical page turn buttons, the higher dpi, and the consistent back lighting. I think the only issue I have with the Voyage is the auto brightness seems a little finicky and I sometimes have to adjust the brightness manually. But that's a small issue for an otherwise great e-reader.",5.0

"I was tired of buying Duracell batteries only to have them start leaking and have to be thrown away even before I could use them at all. So far, these batteries have not leaked at all.

"Excellent purchase, especially for the price. 2 toddlers in the house make batteries a commodity item. There are excellent reviews that compare AmazonBasics to the usual battery brands. I highly suggest you read them to see that there really isn't a difference and since the price is so much lower these are a no brainer.",5.0

"Great price, and shipped safely and Amazon was efficient with the packaging. I bought this pack to replace a 100 pack of Maxell cheap-o batteries that I bought on Amazon years ago. I finally ran out, and decided to try the Performance Alkaline Batteries from AmazonBasics. Quality so far seems to be good. They have been holding their charge well for the devices I'm using them on. These are primarily being used for wireless keyboards and mice, but the area that I've been able to gauge their performance is in a couple of battery operated LED light strings that I use in my studio. With the old batteries, I noticed that I would get about 48 hours of usage before the lights would start to dim. These batteries have been giving me close to double the life. For the price, quite impressed.It's hard to get too fancy on a review for AA batteries, but these happen to work quite well.",5.0
Works well. Fairly easy too program for your specific area.,5.0
This is my first tablet and I'm excited about learning how to use it.,5.0

Me and my husband love them ..we bought 2 for our kids and they love them so easy to use .... and the kids profile is great,5.0
one of the best media player options for streaming TV,5.0
"For $50 I couldn't ask for more! Aside from access to a ridiculous amount of books, I can listen to music, download apps, play games, watch videos, take photos/ record videos (front & rear facing camera), check emails, and surf the web. Although you have to pay for most book/video purchases Amazon also offers Amazon Prime for a month free ($9.99 after) which makes some purchases less expensive. You can also tack on Kindle Unlimited (free 1st month, also $9.99 a month after) to download up to 10 Kindle Unlimited books at a time. As for the possible cons, the lock screen is set as a rotation of sponsored ads (which is why this tablet is so cheap!). If this bothers you, you can remove the ads for $15 on Amazon. The screen/camera resolution and speaker output isn't anything to write home about but it is absolutely great for the price! The glare while using the tablet can also be bothersome, but I purchased an anti-glare screen protector to resolve that issue. With the holidays approaching this is the perfect gift for those on a budget! This would have been the perfect gift for me, had I not already purchased it for myself!",5.0
It's a great product. I not only have books that I read on there but also can download games for my kids.,5.0

"Last got Fire 7"" for my kids, with an Amazon Freetime subscription. These are very good for the price with two flaws: The screen is good and much better than other Android devices at 7"" but not great, and got the 8 Mb version with I would not recommend in hindsight. Because Android's sub-par management on SD cards, got these this year. It has a much better screen, not only larger but with better resolution, adequate speakers for its price, it's fast enough and overall more enjoyable to use. 16 Gb is the minimum I'd recommend, even with SD cards because some apps just work better with internal storage, and some apps even stored in SD will still use some amount of internal storage.It also has Alexa voice support.The main reason for these tablets in my case is the Freetime subscription that has unlimited access to thousands of age-appropriate books, hundreds (or thousand) of free apps and heavily curved web access per age presets. Amazon Fire OS has a decent support for multi-user and in particular kids accounts. My kids are 7 and 9. They spend a lot of time on games as expected but also read a good amount of books.",5.0

"Guys, the Tap does everything Echo does and it's portable! Use it at home for everything, at work on your desk for music, weather, etc, and even poolside as a portable speaker.",5.0
"What's not to love about this item - You'll need a smartphone to set this up (app based) - and then the sky is the limit (we control lights, temp and a few other things in the house as well as listen to music via spotify)I love these items - Speaker is decent (I'm used to bose, denon, etc for sound) so given the size of the echo - the sound output and quality is below that of my BOSE 123 (but it cost lots less and is much more functional)",5.0

"The Fire TV gives me everything I need from a media content perspective to watch shows and movies with several streaming media companies. Netflix, You Tube, etc. User interface is very easy. Going to be giving these as gifts for the family.",5.0
"Great batteries at a reasonable price. These seem to last as long if not longer than your other name brands. I use these in toys, remote controls and other devices around the house, and haven't had any issues at all.",5.0
"What a fun toy this is! It was easy to learn to use, and If I needed help, the online User's Guide is right there. Purchasing books couldn't be easier, and there's no ""hard copy"" to dispose of when you'e done. I was able to check out a book from the public library with little effort. With so many low-cost or no-cost books, as well as current best sellers, there's an endless number to choose from. You can use the search function to search by topic or title. I like using a stylus pen on the touch screen for that. I know I will enjoy my Kindle Voyage for a long time.",5.0

"Even when Im outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book Im reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isnt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes Im on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes Im sitting down. No matter what Im doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it wont allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its dual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life. This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they dont occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I dont limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second Im done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I dont plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isnt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They arent a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they wont appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldnt last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have.",5.0

I have 'Alexa' in the living room. Each morning I ask her the weather forecast and plan my day. If I need to go out I ask her the traffic conditions.

Easy to order easy to keep a reoccurring order if you tend use batteries often. I don't notice a difference between this brand or a more popular branch in terms of durability.

"I love it, very user friendly! Great for the kids, lots of aps, great purchase and great price!",5.0
"I bought this tablet as a gift for my mother-in-law, who is not very tech-savvy. She already owns a laptop, but was interested in getting a tablet to use while watching TV, rather than a whole laptop. She also travels around quite a bit, so having something light she could take with her was a big plus. I've owned a couple Amazon tablets before, so I had an idea of how they worked, and I wanted something at a low price point, so I decided on this. So far, she loves it! A couple of important points:-The low price point comes at the cost of hardware. After using my Fire HDX, this tablet felt just a little slow, but not excessively so. It performed better in basic tasks (loading apps, web browsing, etc) than I expected based on my experiences with other tablets at similar price points.-As an Amazon tablet, this runs a modified version of Android, but does NOT have baked-in access to Google services (including the Google Play Store). You will be restricted to Amazon-approved apps, unless you sideload apps on your own, or are able to get access to Google services yourself. Popular apps like Netflix, Skype, and Facebook are all present, but the selection pales in comparison to native Android.",5.0
Great deal on batteries!,5.0
"Good tablet for the price. It is fast, battery life is ok.",5.0

I love this for the sheer fact that I don't have to carry around all of the different books I am reading. Those books can get heavy! The syncing between reading and listening on Audible has really improved since I tried using it with the original Kindle Fire tablet.,5.0

"Totally satisfied. Also own Apple TV, which I ended up moving to bedroom and putting fire stick on main TV. Fire stick seems to be more ""open"" to multiple programmings compared to App Store only programs with Apple TV. But, In defense for Apple TV it's syncing abilities with my iPhone and MacBook are well received. Price wise Firestick has the advantage.",5.0
Can be educational and lots of fun too. A variety of uses for Alexa.,5.0
"I didn't have any expectations before buying the Fire tablet (which may have been a good thing). With the discount offered over Black Friday, I just couldn't resist. Well, I am totally amazed at how good it is, especially considering that it only cost me $33. I download ebooks from my library, surf the web, do my email so what is there not to like? Sure, it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of an iPad but, for me, it is the ideal portable internet device (even better than my mobile phone).",5.0

"Amazon echo is simply an amazing product. I was able to set it up in minutes. In addition to all of the normal stuff you see on TV commercials it also integrates well with with all of my existing gadgets (Nest thermostats, Rachio sprinklers, Fitbit, Security system, Harmony remote hub, etc through IFTTT. My wife loves watering her flowers outside just by asking Alexa. The only thing I am really mad about is that it's now $20 than I bought it from Best Buy 4 days ago.",5.0
"Nice product for the price , very good tablet for beginners",5.0
"This is such a great deal that I opted for the 100-battery package rather than spend the same amount on a pack of rechargeable AA's. At only 13 cents per AA cell, it is less than the cost of X minutes of my labor associated with charging multiple rounds of rechargeables (since I only have a 4-bay charger.) If you need a sizeable number of batteries at once, this deal is hard to beat.They're all meticulously packed in 4-cell wrappers, so you won't have 100 batteries rattling around and tipping over in a jumbled mess. The entire line of AmazonBasics products is impressive----these batteries are no exception. I will definitely repurchase these.",5.0
"Not only does what Siri does, but it takes it one step further by completing tasks that you ask it to do, like ordering pizza or ubers, which I do plenty of. With extra devices hooked to lights in your home, for example, you can ask Echo to turn your lights on, dim them, etc., before entering the home. This can be a real safety feature.",5.0
Best tablet for the price by far. Its also conveint they have it in stock at best buy.,5.0

That's when I found this little jewel along with the Kindle Fire AC charger. And they both work like a DREAM!.

"While there are many budget tablets out there, not all of them are functional. This one is. If you are part of the Amazon universe this links seamlessly. Book purchases sync without effort. Movies are easy to see on Amazon Prime and you can use Netflix also. Alexa is an added bonus. Not sure the camera will get much use but it is there if you want it. Amazon is slowly opening up their market place to other popular apps so expect more. (Note: I turned off the WiFi and just used this as an e-reader and didn't have to charge it for almost 2 weeks!)",5.0

"This was purchased as a gift, but I now have the intention of purchasing for myself, because of how much they love it.",5.0

"This tablet is so great for the price, but Amazon has always put out excellent product. This is fairly lightweight and pretty fast too. Like all Amazon product it ties all your Amazon accounts so downloads and purchases are super easy. I have dropped it a couple of times and no damage... so it's pretty tough too.",5.0
This is my 4th kindle and is easily the best one I've ever had. It is very comfortable to hold and is very compact. I was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles. It may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery.,5.0
