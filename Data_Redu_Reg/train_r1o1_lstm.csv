i came here to look at the one and two star reviews and see that people are saying the same thing ive been thinking since trying to use my first shipment of these batteries which are supposed to be better than the previous version that they replaced ive used  of these batteries so far and each one has barely lasted  weeks in my mouse the previous version usually lasted a couple months at least it seems like in this day and age its rare that when things are supposedly improved upon that theyre actually better i can only guess that amazon found a cheaper supplier for their branded batteries i guess its time to cancel my subscribe and save subscription since im not the only one who finds these batteries to be subpar to their predecessors if the rest of the batteries in this pack perform better ill update my review to reflect thatedited to add on  now that the th battery from this pack lasted just over  weeks in my mouse i will be contacting amazon customer service as i mentioned previously the older version of these batteries worked so well that i have to wonder why they changed them i see the larger size amazon batteries still carry the older name,1.0,negative
currently this is the fifth version of the kindle fire that i purchased since they came out purchased this one due to its ability to maximize storage with a sd card unlike the other ones i have it seemed to not run as smooth as my kindle fire hdx once i started adding apps to it which is not a problem for me since i use other tablets for that this was mainly purchased to download shows and movies from amazon prime to watch offline,4.0,positive

its a nice looking cover will keep the fire clean but not particularly safe in a fall i have the black one it is very professional looking no padding whatsoever it does wake the fire up when opened and shut down when closed but that has never been important to me my problem with all of the cases is that you have to hold the cover out in order to keep the camera clear and it makes clicking the shutter a little awkward id like to see an opening on the front cover that matches up to the opening on the back so you can have it folded in half and still be able to view the subject,3.0,neutral

works great until i had forgotten that amazon fire did not come with google playstore i looked up how to add playstore to the  fire there are many videos on youtube that showed how to add playstore to the fire all seemed to add it ok but the loss performance of the fire was noticeable there were several apps that failed to work at all or lost features one example was lifetime it was slow to load and failed to bring up chromecast one reason i hoped for this app would work was my samsung and vizio smart tvs dont offer this app i found a old tablet i had forgotten i had i loaded lifetime and works perfect i guess what it boils down to it you are after apps on the playstore get a non amazon tablet it is just easier to use apps should work and you dont have to fool around trying to adapt playstore if playstore isnt critical then im sure this a a great little table,3.0,neutral

the reason people give it  stars is because they dont give the product enough time before they review it i purchased this along with my kindle dx on august   i can honestly say that i dont recommend this product as it will damage the kindle the hinge that attaches to the kindle will eventually put pressure on the kindle front plastic cover and soon you will see it crack to avoid this you have to make sure the kindle doesnt rock back and forth from off the back cover causing the hinge to bend more and crack the front plastic further this is hard to do if you open and close your kindle many times a day or simply lend it to someone else who doesnt know better one thing i can honestly say is that i really wanted to like this product i really wanted it to work im looking for a slip cover now,1.0,negative

these batteries are only ok they dont last as long as duracell and when they die its usually instantly one moment they seem to work fine the very next moment they are outputting half power i would say that about half of these batteries just simply died while being used no warning no gradual loss of power simply dead they also seem to be marginally shorter than brandname batteries but to be honest i havent measured them suffice it to say ive decided that i would rather spend the few extra cents per battery on brandname batteries its simply not worth the savings in my opinion ive had similar experience with dollar store batteries,3.0,neutral

i dont want to get too negative on this because it does what its supposed to however im not sure how amazon justifies charging  half that and id feel a lot less disappointed its nothing like the last generation cover which was hefty and substantial that thing could take a beating this one ummnot so muchpros i really like the solution amazon came up with to lock the kindle in place sort of a rubberized cup that grips it on all four sides and holds it very securely no more metalprong sliderelease gizmo it looks quite nice and is genuine if untextured leather like the last onecons flimsy the leather is extremely thin and unpadded wont stand up to much abuse scrape it even lightly on a rough surface and youll likely ruin it the actual cover that folds over the front is incredibly floppy and delicate  its about the thickness of a piece of notepad cardboard i could bend it in half with almost no effort if i had the notion cover has no lockclosure mechanism like the elastic strap on the last gen model it should have somethingoh well it is what it is i never read with the kindle in the case anyway so its not such a big deal to me but i was expecting more especially for this price,2.0,negative
a little disappointed with my first experience with ai you have to learn to communicate with alexa to get results i feel like she should have to learn more about me than i her however i understand she is a gen  and would expect that future versions will closer be to the jetsons than something that keeps telling me i didnt understand what you said i doubt amazon will update the existing units with better technology they will want to you to buy it all over again instead of making a loyal or invested customer happy she does have a lot knowledge you just have to figure how to ask for it or download an additional skillapplication,3.0,neutral

i purchased the amazon echo a little over a month ago i like the concept of the echo but unfortunately its not as responsive as i had hoped trying to get local news is nearly impossible its also not in sync with my amazon account packages i ordered on amazon that are delivered it will still tell me are still in route i think the speaker is a decent quality and i stream music quite often i probably would not buy it again too expensive for the limited things it can do again i like the concept but it still needs a lot of improvementsits advertised as though it will make your life easier but other than creating a shopping list for me i have not had an overwhelming life enhancing experience,3.0,neutral

if you are looking for something to help you keep more organized or keep you up to date with weather markets and the latest news the amazon echo show is what you are looking for honestly the product is top of the line technology and is easy to use as long you are patient and work with it and read the directions the size of it is truly perfect it honestly reminds me of the size of normal alarm clock that would have on a nightstand and with that it truly can serve that purpose it also has a touch screen and i feel it is very durable and can stand to last the sound quality is also superb with dual inch speakers it has bluetooth capabilities as well but it only works with android samsung fire os ios device excluding mac products the echo show comes in two colors black and white the product has many different features and functions and they can accommodate pretty much anyoneäôs needs the top feature is the alexa app which is an application in which you can call commands and ask it questions about most anything then i believe the music capabilities are truly amazing and how you can ask it to play almost any song or playlist whenever you want also you can tell it to volume up or down as well another new modernized technology it has is the capability to do hands free voice command smart home options a couple things that could be improved is sometimes that it does not fully hear your exact words and it will search for something you arenäôt expecting the other function it could have is it could have single voice recognition to only several voices so then you donäôt have the entire room trying to mess with it constantly the price is also fair as well for its creative capabilities it has so if you are trying to find some new technology to add to your home the echo show would be a great addition for you,4.0,positive

i am extremely disappointed with these batteries which stems not from longevity or power but with fit almost immediately upon receiving them i installed them into three electric candles no joy i cleaned the contacts still no joy i tested the batteries full charge just for grins i installed into one candle three rayovac brand batteries and the candle lit with no problem removed the rayovacs installed the amazons and again no joy i repeated this a couple of times with the same results and i tried this in the other two candles with identical results all three candles lit with the rayovacs none with the amazons knowing the issue was not with candles i took a rayovac and lined it up with an amazon and discovered something interesting the batteries were just a wee bit differentthe length of the positive terminals are different just a tad longer on the rayovac see picture the rayovac terminal is taller longer while the amazon terminal is squattier and therefore shorter the difference in length is tiny no question but when youre putting batteries into a rather cheap device to start with that tiny bit of length in this case seems to be the difference between one battery forming a sufficient connection and the other one not ill keep the amazons to use in devices mice for example that are likely more solidly built than these candles and have a greater connection tolerance or a stronger spring to hold the battery firmly in place i am concluding that when replacing batteries in an older device that may not force as firm a connection or in a cheapo device that may not hold batteries tightly from the getgo use a brandedname batteryi am a longtime and extremely satisfied user of amazon basic computer cables among their first products in the basics line but was recently disappointed with another item i purchased outside of the computer connectors and cables line that being dog housetraining piddle pads which have not proven as absorbent as similarlypriced products and ive bought a lot of different brands the batteries were my second foray into basics product lines outside of the ohsodependablecables arena and now im  for  in the disappointed column i never thought there was a difference in batteries and now i know differently the next time i see a duracell commercial emphasizing reliability and dependability ill think back to this experience as i will when selecting batteries in the future i so wanted to like these amazon batteries too,2.0,negative

this cover is made for the kindle dx and fits it beautifully the problem  and its a big one  is if you accidentlly try to open the cover from the back which is very easy to do you can damage the kindle without even realizing whats happened my husband did this and cracked the kindle frame within the first week of owning the device fortunately only the frame was cracked and the kindle still works we cannot however remove the cover because of the way it hooks into the device the hook closure must be bent because of the accidental attempt to open the back cover after the incident we attempted to clip the back cover to the kindle but found this to be cumbersome and the clip would not stay in place we are just extremely careful now but the damage was done almost immediately i hope this design flaw has been fixed,1.0,negative

its not a very powerful tablet i needed something just to view netflix and some other videos not to mention play some music and look at photos other than that i think its too weak not good for gaming for the price though you cant beat it,4.0,positive
overall for an alexa product it does the same thing as all the other ones this one is specifically portable and only needs to be put on the base for charging the one main issue is that it is not voice activated meaning it does not listen to you unless you press any of the buttons on top or the mic button in front by having this feature i could see it causing excess battery usage needs to be able to apps better,3.0,neutral

this charger fried my kindle fire samsung galaxy s and samsung galaxy j do not plug your other devices up to it it easily comes detached from the fire tablet but does charge it im just very unhappy that it killed my other devices there are young children in my home and they know the difference between apple and android charging tips so they will use any available charging cable they find when needed,2.0,negative
would give it a  star if the battery lasted as long as they claim but its worth the extra charging times for the nice design so light and easy in your hand especially without the cover but using the cover is comfortable as well the leather cover smells a bit when it arrives but i let it air out for a few days before using it and now its fine nice quality leather and i love the merlot color the page turn buttons are easier to use than the buttons on the voyage screen looks the same even though they claim there are more backlights on this one im very happy with my oasis,4.0,positive
this version of kindle was not very impressive to me navigating was easier on my older kindle this model is smaller also i have had an issue with charging on this device since i purchased it when it does accept the charge it will charge to  rather quickly however the battery life dies out so much faster as well at times when i am using i will try to keep the charger connected due to this problem however it is constantly making a ding noise off and on as the charger connection does not fit well  keeps falling out i even purchased another charger to see if this would alleviate the issue it did not,2.0,negative

bought this tablet for price and for a little kid using it so i wasnt expecting it to be a flag ship device but this really isnt the best the amazon version of android really ruins things you cant get the same apps that you would get from the android play store many apps on this amazon app store are just not the same and the apps you do get are mainly made by others for ex youtube someone basically made the website into an app but its  so its whatever,3.0,neutral

so i was already not too pleased with amazons choice to only include an essentially useless charger when purchasing a kindle hd and caved to ordering the fast charger so it would not take hours of nonuse to recharge for  you dont even get a full charger just an adapter to put on to the cord they already gave you amazon please just charge the real price for the device instead of settling to slowly rip people off with essential accessories this sort of thing cheapens your image and erodes loyalty,1.0,negative
decent speed and a nice screen make this a great device for the money i find myself using it more and more,5.0,positive
okay so i have been debating for days on whether to rate this thing  or  stars and i still want to rate it  and a half but i have settled for  stars here is whyprosthe only real reason i wanted this case over the others is because every other case holds the kindle in with straps around the edges and this is the only case that holds the kindle in while letting you see the whole front side it holds it in perfectly neither feeling loose or too tight to get it out the black leather is genuine leather and smells nice and while the front cover is very thin if you tap on it you get a hollow drum sound and it can be bent without much effort it takes mild amounts of abuse without a problem also the flap folds back perfectly and when you are reading you hardly notice the kindle has a case onconsmy main complaint is the quality of the leather if you compare this to the case for the kindle  keyboard the leather is a little thinner but much less durable i sometimes lightly hold my kindle between my teeth when i run out of hands and after a week i can still see my tooth marks whereas on the k case i couldnt also even a mild scratch will either take several days to disappear update most scratches will mostly disappear so its not as big a problem as i originally thoughtthe only other complaint is of course the lack of anything to hold the cover closed but this has actually not been much of a problem for me quite often i like to frisbee toss my kindle onto a nearby soft surface like carpet or a pillow or bed and i was afraid the cover would flap open every time but  times out of the  i tried it stayed shut just fineread more,4.0,positive
the price was right but they just dont last as long as the other name brand batteries so its not worth it,1.0,negative

i always put new batteries in my three thermostats at the beginning of the heating season in late sept to make sure they work through the winter never had a problem with energizer or duracell going the whole year these batteries from amazon all had to be replaced in february wont be using them again,2.0,negative
whats happened to batteries duracell use to be the gold standard until we had over  of them fail by leaking and destroying expensive medical equipment year after year costco batteries became our goto batteries until last year  when they started leaking even on the shelf tried eveready but price and quality varies as well i trusted amazon and love the price packaging convenience and no leaks but they dont last half the time the others have some of the top reviews have stated the electrical case very very well and yes we have some high current draw uses but as my staff and doctors have said to me theyre just batteries get us some decent batteries already we go through dozens a week so price is going to matter but paying top dollar still doesnt seem to save equipment or increase the usage time it seems every manufacture is changing their product for cost and marketing so that you have to be an expert to properly match basic aa batteries to your specific use not cool,1.0,negative

its a decent quality tablet for the money one complaint is the speakers are weak have to cup my hand around the speaker side to get some good feedback the silk browser seems to have issues with search engines just switching the search engine fixes it thoughi got this for when the power goes out at my house its served to let me watch netflix with a bluetooth keyboard it seems adequate for messaging and writing out notesvideo quality is good enough though that has more to do with not being super picky about it im considering gifting my dad one of these this year he commented that the quality looked good another complaint would be the amazon app store is limited no clash royale which is the only mobile game i actually enjoy im sure theres a way around this but im really not interested in digging around for it so for the most part its a good solid low end tablet,3.0,neutral

my initial impression of this was very good the material is nicer than the shiny stuff on my hama cd binders and the netting trim gives a nice appearance compared to plain look of most budget cd bindersthere are  pages with  disc pockets each  per side giving a total of  capacity the pages are hung from the spine in two groups of  by that i mean that  pages all have a single attachment point to the plastic spinethis is where the first problem with this binder lies because each group of  pages shares the same anchor point in the spine the pages cannot sit flat once full of discs they bend and arch and apart from looking tatty this puts a lot of tension across the plastic film with longterm usage i suspect this plastic film will will tear due to the tension it also makes it awkward to browse the binder as the pages dont sit flat it may even crack or bend your discsi look to my hama  binder to see how it should be done  it only has  pages and yet they were smart enough to hang them from the spine in  bundles of  this spreads out the pages and allows easy browsing of the binder without putting any of the pockets under tensionafter just  weeks in storage i opened the binder and the corners of all the pages have become dogeared by themselves this is due to the poor design and poor fit of the binder pages when filled with discs again it is not a problem i have seen with my other disc binders my twoyearold hama binders look as good as newoverally this binder has a lot of storage at a good price if thats all you want you will probably be happy with the product but sloppy design prevents it from being anything more than a mediocre binder i feel that whoever designed this did not bother to fill it with discs to see how it would cope,2.0,negative

i am reading positive reviews and wish i could say the same best buy is great so this is not a reflection on them just our experience with the product we have had this product for just over one month and i have had to contact amazon support perform factory resets to get content to show up and the device is poorly designed as the sd card pops out constantly which messes with drm and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the internet to fix it we are returning and spending the extra money for an ipad will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience if you just use the device for reading maybe this is for you but trying to download information to sd card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating as well as having to do factory resets so content owned already purchased on amazon would show up on the device in the library,1.0,negative

i have owned kindles for many years and have always been very happy with their portability performance and ease of use the highly expandable memory is what lead me to purchase this kindle for my son there are only two areas that i am very disappointed the first in the parental control settings in order to ensure that my son cannot make endless onetouch purchases and i mean oneeasy little touch i must set the controls either off or on the problem with this is that he then has no internet access or extremely limited access so limited that he cannot access content i normally allow him to accessbig problem now amazon is pretty good about refunding unintended app purchases there is a cancel button but then you must wait days or more for the refund to be credited this is an issue that i am getting more frustrated with as we move through time with this purchase the second issue amazons kindle app store is weak if you can find some of the apps that you are searching for they may not be entirely supported by the device such as facebooka major app and a major downfall to kindle use because of this last issue both my son and i have apple devices to supplement what we cannot do on our kindle all this being said however my son and i both very much enjoy what the kindles do have to offer so they get a good rating because of thishowever because of the issues i discussed it was difficult to choose between an average and good rating,4.0,positive

the paperwhite is certainly better than the regular kindle primarily due to the back lighting feature if you buy a kindle ereader this would be the one to buy you could spend more for the higher end models but theres really no need the main issue with this ereader is the smudge effect at the bottom of the screen i tried two paperwhites and both had the same issue perhaps this is just how they are,3.0,neutral

i really wanted to love the amazon aa batteries but they just are not durable enough for my usage as a night time long distance runner i have led headlamps with a rear red flashing light that i use which require  aa batteriesi usually purchase duracell or energizer batteries in bulk and they have worked well rechargeable batteries are not very good in led headlamps so those are outthe problem with the amazon batteries is that i get about  or  hours of strong light then it really fades fast the longest i have used the amazon batteries is  hours and by then the light is less than  brightness the other issue i noticed with these batteries is that the front headlight will lightly flash in time with the rear light once the front brightness is reduced when i test the batteries with a tester they are only  way through the green rangeduracell and energizers give me nearly    hours at full brightness and maybe  or  hours with  i have not seen the light flashing when the brightness drops on the these batteries when i test the batteries after the light is reduced they are in the yellow or red areathe amazon batteries give me two less than the energizers and duracells which is significant i average  night time runs with the duracells and energizers and  sometimes  with amazon batteriesthese may be perfect in remote controls and other static use devices but if it has to drive a light or a motor you may want to skip thesethe light pictures show new  and  hoursthe nd light shows new and  hoursthe battery tester shows new   and  hours,3.0,neutral

it all depends on what your using a  dollar tablet to do is it for extreme gaming then i highly do not recommend this device it is better for light use on the safe side use for h a day h a day battery is the average but runs down faster and over heats when playing a d game but if u are on tight budget it is useful another major problem is that almost all apps that you would get on iphone and android are not availabe on the amazon fire appstore and there is no way to download them for example clash of clans racing rivals which have decided to withdraw from the amazon contract and delte there game off amazons app stores and other bigger titles omg even snapchat is not on there,2.0,negative

i wanted to like this a lot because my ipad mini is heavy to carry in my purse all the time this is so very light but they make you jump through hoops to get rid of all the advertising on the device and when you buy it at best buy you are not given a choice to spend an extra  on a  dollar book or put up with their ads i had to go through being on hold forever to get someone to help get this off my device so that was an immediate turnoff i dont find it to pageturn handle as well as my old original nook or nook color and certainly not anything like the ipad mini if i hadnt kept it too long to return i would have it doesnt auto correct to landscape then portrate nope you have to manually choose one or the other and going back and forth is just stupidit should have been part of the improved design they really missed the mark for the price i can get a full tablet for less money that does all that and simply use the kindle appproslight weightsmall for purseback lightconscomes preloaded with adsnot easy to get them off if you buy device in a storepage control is not that simplet doesnt auto turn from landscape to portrate you have to set it to one or the othernot as touch responsive to anythingdont like the organization of it,2.0,negative

an okay reader reading from an ipad mini is better under all conditions except outside in sunlight plus with the ipad you can play games web search etc the kindle library function is not nearly as good as the kindle app on the ipad where you can see many more of your books on a page and scroll through them all quickly versus the slow swipe function of the kindle i also do not like the page turn of the kindle versus apple every page turned on kindle is like slow motion and about every fifth page refreshes entirely i actually have to go to the top of the next page slowly in order to not have to wait for the kindle slow page turn even the reading in the outdoors feature of the kindle is not as great as reviewers indicate as there is still the sun glare on pages that you have to deal with although at least you can read with it outdoors the kindle also suffers from a shadow along the bottom of the screen the explanation is that it is actually a shadow that is between the lights that are shining upward for night time reading draw your own conclusions as to whether that is good engineering it is worse on some of the devices i saw than on others kindle serves the purpose for reading at the beach and not worrying if it accidently gets damaged i would never take an ipad to the beach but the kindle is almost disposable in contrast maybe  stars is being a bit generous but it is a good supplement to the ipad if apple ever makes their device so it can be used outside without a glare then i dont see any market for the kindle at that point not sorry i have a kindle but for what i decided to buy it for reading at beach it is at the price point where it is not really worth it i still read paper books for those who remember what those are and those still work perfectly for beach reading,3.0,neutral
