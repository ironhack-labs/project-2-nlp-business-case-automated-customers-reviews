this   version should have been marketed to children only its like a very dumbed down cheap version of the better firehd and hdx screen is not as good battery life is bad no mirroring to tv and its slooowww as can be if youve never owned another kind of kindle you will probably be accepting of this watered down version for those that know what a real kindle should be like you may want to pass on this one another version should be along soon and since they cant get much worse than this one youll probably get a better one i got mine on black friday for a little over  total with shopping discounts and im still sending it back thats how disappointed i am with it,1.0,negative

i bought  of these on black friday and these have to be one of the worst buys of my life the screen saver cant be changed so my kids are forced to look at ads every time they want to use their tablet apps are ok and to be honest i could have dealt with the ads but the final deal breaker for me is the sd card i bought my kids sd cards so they can have more than  games and the tablet doesnt read it or something it says sd card inserted but it wont download apps to the sd card,1.0,negative
slow advertisement plagued save and spend money on something better,1.0,negative
i got two of these batteries with my fire tv stick loaded them in and everything was good for  days then the fire tv stick stopped responding i trouble shooted with no fix called customer service and they had me trouble shoot too started by saying can you change the batteries my response  seriously you want me to change the batteries its a freaking tv stick what could possibly be wrong the batteries are brand new and came with the device so i was changing the batteries as i was saying all that only for the new batteries to fix the problem so these amazon batteries died in  days how does that happen,1.0,negative

all i can say as soon as i opened this tablet it never ever turned on i was so upset as ive followed the troubleshooting steps from other users online and still it never worked i fully charged the tablet and tried again and still it never turned on i had a very hard time at the best buy returning this item had to spend an hour and explained the situation to them they never believed me this item came to be defective after storming out and after a while they have decided to accept the return and gave me credit for iti would never buy an amazon product ever again piece of junk bad quality productthanks,1.0,negative
worst batteries i ever bought less than one hour after installing in remote popup on tv said remote battery low left them in and got about four hours more use before it wouldnt turn on the receiver the aas i bought seem to be fine not sure why the aaas didnt last put  new ones in the remote  well see how these do the second set of four were no better than the first low battery warning after a few hours use surfing dish tv program guide all showed just over  volts before installation checked again when first low battery warning came up down to  volts guess i got an old bad batch nothing but duracell from here on out would not recommend these batteries ,1.0,negative

i was excited about the amazon echo however after getting it home setting it up and finding out how limiting it is that excitement went away fast the echo couldnt answer the majority of questions or would be asked a question and instead of answering it would play country music which i never asked forunless you have smart home features like a smart thermostat or smart lights etc it is useless aside from being a speaker which for the money it isnt a good speakeri did however try it for a week finding it not worth it or that googling questions was easier to answer even asking it about what movies were near me etc was a pain some said maybe i got a defective unit which wasnt the case the echo is just limited in what it can doi would say save your money this isnt worth it yet,1.0,negative
do not purchase these batteries leaked in a machine i was using in my kids room to project stars on the ceiling when i picked the projector up it leaked battery fluid on me and burned my arms and legs it could have gotten on my children the leaking fluid also ruined the projectorthe batteries were new stored at room temp used at room temp not recharged and not exposed to any fluid or abnormal conditions disposing in the appropriate mannereta i was very happy with amazons resolution despite this bad experience thanks amazon ill order batteries from you again just not your brand,1.0,negative
i waited a couple months to review giving amazon time to make this product equal to the sony dash from nearly a decade ago it isnt the screen provides nothing of value and you cant turn of amazon tips you have near zero customization cant even move the clock to the other side of the screen and something that a sony dash did nearly  years ago pandora or prime music as an alarm seriously this is the biggest fail run away from this half baked amazon disaster,1.0,negative
i updated my credit car d more than six weeks ago i wont bother you in the future,1.0,negative
everything i had read was a bit confusing on how the echo can control it but low and behold it has the alexa service built into it the echo cannot control the amazon fire tv which was the sole reason i bought it well also in hopes that hbo now would have surround sound on it but of course it didnt so theyre both at fault here and the reason why i returned it immediately since neither of the above worked this made the device completely redundant with my chromecast,1.0,negative

this thing is garbage do not buy it is the slowest charger ive every had it is not a fast charger it is a disgrace that amazon is offering this product as a fast charger and discontinued the previous all black square blocky fast charger which really was a fast charger this thing is not a fast charger save your money amazon needs to seriously check their supplier the manufacturer of this junkadvertising this thing as a fast charger is totally deceptive,1.0,negative
i am reading positive reviews and wish i could say the same best buy is great so this is not a reflection on them just our experience with the product we have had this product for just over one month and i have had to contact amazon support perform factory resets to get content to show up and the device is poorly designed as the sd card pops out constantly which messes with drm and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the internet to fix it we are returning and spending the extra money for an ipad will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience if you just use the device for reading maybe this is for you but trying to download information to sd card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating as well as having to do factory resets so content owned already purchased on amazon would show up on the device in the library,1.0,negative
ouch i bought this fire tablet and used it for about four hours and left it on a charger a couple of hours later i picked up the tablet and the screen was showing a weird ghosting effect and then the screen went completely blacki twisted the chassis and screen a bit and managed to get things working again just long enough to do a factory reset and return the tabletim sure i had a defectivedamaged tablet but i was underwhelmed with the quality and it would be nice if amazon brought back the higher quality hdx tablets for people who dont mind paying more for quality tablets,1.0,negative
the amazon fire hd  tablet no longer was able to charge less than six months after being received as a christmas present i contaced amazon assuming that the was a one year warranty amazon tech support navigated me through a number of trouble shooting steps and concluded that the usb port is defective i was then told that this product only has a  day warranty and the best they could do in give me a  on my next amazon purchase wow,1.0,negative

purchased it tonight time is wrong you cannot change time manually because it has to have wifi to update the timeand it wont connect to any wifi that needs a passcode or password because it has to have correct time this is  technology amazon ive had many devices but none that make you find a wifi without a password hard to do because starbucks hotels etc all need you to click to agree to their terms for wifi all because the time cannot be changed without wifireturning it tomorrowps also an issue on the amazon forums so i am not the only one dealing with this,1.0,negative
i went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews but my experience was not a good one from the start i was on the phone every day for at least an hour with amazon tech support for one issue or another most of the techs were very polite but not all knew the product very well at one point i asked one of them about trying to save some ram and they kept referring me to the storage which told me they didnt even know the difference between ram and regular storage the internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times even when all my other wifi devices ran great then a day would pass and id be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop workingwtf come to find out its a known issue and theyre working on it after two weeks of one thing after another i got fed up and just returned it i wanted it to work and gave it a good run but just not quality stuff to me it was like walmart trying to build their own computer when theyre obviously not a computer manufacturer neither is amazon if i were you id look at a regular android tablet from a reputable pc manufacturer which is exactly what i did next i got an asus tablet for only a few dollars more and its unbelievable  better in comparison to the amazon fire hd save yourself the aggravation and go with asus or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time sorry amazon not this time,1.0,negative

no reason this product is described as w  amp the kindle line is mainly v v whats the difference and around  amp which is  watts w why the mystery guys also this deal is for us v market only i travel i like that the previous simple fire charger was universal ie vv i like that the first kindle charger was also universal what are you people doing or is it that the copywriter in this case just doesnt understandfor those who dont understand the details of electricity any device will tell you what it needs to feed voltage v is one thing to look at and your charger needs to say something within the range of  and  volts to meet your device need as far as amps a if your device says it needs  a its perfectly fine to buy a charger that has a rating higher than that like  amps the device will only drink as much as it needs a device that needs  a plugged into a  a charger just means the charger is taking a nap just avoid situations where your device needs more amps than a charger can provide it wont necessarily explode but it will extend charge times and is generally not recommended,1.0,negative

basically has almost the same content as a roku  would provide but in a much more clunkier menu i can get a better amazon menu layout via the amazon app on the roku  also for those that were hoping to pick up some extra football via fox sports network fs that is not happening you can add the channel free but in order to watch any content you will still need a cable or satellite subscription which defeats the whole purpose of adding the app for us cord cutters there is no way i am signing back up for cable or satellite i wish fs would get with the program and offer a separate subscription such as hbo and showtime do its a thumbs down for me,1.0,negative

i purchased the amazon fire tv after owning the roku  for a year and after trying both the older and the newest versions and apple tv i am a prime member so this seemed like a perfect choice however the remote is very unresponsive disconnecting more than it stays connected the menu layout is very adcentric and pushes you towards how amazon wants you to view their service when the remote works the amazon tv seems sluggish in comparison to the other products i tried after several hours of fighting with the remote i decided to return it and get another rokupossibly the version  good try amazon but far from being close to either roku or apple tv,1.0,negative

i have found that a large percentage of these batteries only last about half as long as duracell i had assumed that since amazon doesnt own a battery factory that these are simply a major brand that is private labeled so i assumed they would last just as long my tv remote came with a sony battery it lasted a year i replaced it with one of these and it only lasted  months,2.0,negative
i am all about amazon basics but i have ordered several of these for our baby toys and they dont compare at all to the duracell procell that i normally order would love to go for a great generic brand but this just isnt it ive been through several of these and they are consistently much faster to run out than the procells,2.0,negative

pros amazon prime works on it you can still sideload apps like kodicons not a good upgrade over the original fire tv is worse in some aspects remote buttons are hard to press compared to original fire tv remote loses connection frequently and takes several button presses or removing of the remote batteries to fix interface isnt as snappy as the original fire tv same interface as the original fire tv theres still no good way to sort your apps or locate the prime content that you want voice search seems about the same as the original fire tv alexa adds nothing significant you still cant use it to search in rd party apps like youtube as for video decoding in kodi performance isnt much better than the original fire tv you will be able to play hevc content at p with no problem but p  hip softwaredecoded does not play well theres simply not enough power k decoding is hitand miss it needs to be specifically coded for this fire tv low bitrate low fps to work properly overall system performance is bad when sitting idle the cpus spike up to  usage and memory is at  usage the os is not welloptimizedim not confident that amazon can fix these issues in a timely manner and their competitors are releasing their media players soon so ill likely return this while i still can,2.0,negative

amazon fire is a good tablet if you like ebooks its also nice to get a sixmonth subscription to the washington post their claim to have  gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you  and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage another problem is that you cant flag something as being inappropriate like you can on samsung galaxy tablets,2.0,negative

if you are looking for an inexpensive tablet just for basic web surfingshoppingetc i dont know that you can get a better deal however that is about all you can do we found out the hard way that the fire which we bought to replace a misplaced ipad so maybe we were just spoiled is pretty limited in terms of the apps you can download forget about any google based apps and many of the standard apps that are generally available in the android or apple market place i love amazon itself and dont have any major issues with the product i got for the price i paid i just wont be going the cheap route in the future hindsight being  i should have spent the money to just get a new ipad since that is what we were used to,2.0,negative

i didnt expect a lot at this price but i also did not expect both of my tablets to be riddled with deadstuck pixels right out of the box i have a third arriving in the mail and am just praying that i am at least good for  waiting on its arrival before doing the trip for returnreplacement just in case that one needs to go as well maybe just bad luck but definitely worth noting for anyone who may also be inconvenienced by having to do a returneverything else seems good though when you can look past the display issues but may be worth waiting until these defective lots have been disbursed and the issues have been correctedi am sure if you dont have these display issues that the product deserves more than  stars but if you can see things from my perspective it is kind of difficult to recommend this to anyone for the time being if the display did not have these pixel issues i could see this easily being a  star recommendation if you do a little research you will see that there are definitely some lot numbers that are more problematic than others so this is not just a rare incident if it is for you and you plan to grab one from a brick and mortar location do yourself a favor and just boot it up before you drive home ,2.0,negative
very difficult to connect to you tube very frustrating,2.0,negative
if you shop on amazon all the time this will help make it easier still lots of ads pop up and you cant use apps from nonamazon sources unless you root it and that is complicated this is not a realistic alternative to an ipad or galaxy note if you just want to a device to shop on amazon with youll love it,2.0,negative

ive always been a fan of the kindle ever since the first one came out over a decade againi was excited about this kindle due to the many premium features it showed  the allmetal finish highresolution epaper display backlighting extended battery life etci was significantly disappointed to see that amazon pushes ads through the kindle when you put it into sleep mode and throughout the store options additionally i was further frustrated by the fact that i learned there was a cellular version available direct from amazon but not through the store for such an expensive unit to have ads with no option to disable them seems unreasonable and like a ripoff additionally the fact that this only supports wifi not cellular or whispersync makes it even more of a drawback and something i would not recommend to a friend  stick with the cheaper versioni also found annoying problems trying to get my apple airpod earphones to work with this device pairing took forever to finish or work had to try three different times and if the unit sits for too long i found that i had to go through the entire pairing process again they were not automatically connected and synced the moment i had both devices turned on,2.0,negative

i want to start out by pointing out that i honestly was not expecting much to begin with i was just hoping for something backlit to read with at night my problem with it is that it was slow to the point where it was almost unusable just bite the bullet and get a more expensive model if youre new to amazon fire this is not representative of the experience of owning one,2.0,negative
got this for my yo daughter a lot of the times it doesnt work i have to restart it a lot and it only has  apps that i added on it it came with way too many preloaded apps and the most annoying thing is that the kids profile is permanently horizontal not really worth the money for me but at least shes playing her inside out bubble game on her own tablet instead of my ipad,2.0,negative

amazon fire is a good tablet if you like ebooks its also nice to get a sixmonth subscription to the washington post their claim to have  gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you  and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage  another problem is that you cant flag something as being inappropriate like you can on samsung galaxy tablets,2.0,negative
its somewhat of a step up from the roku  i was previously using but not as much as i was expecting i think its a couple firmware updates away from being better than it is nowspent the good part of the day trying to figure out why i could only connect to my dualband router at ghz and not ghz  hours on the phone with verizon fios tech support was unsuccessful as other devices connected at ghz without issue was about to pack it up and return it until i called amazon tech support turns out its a knownissue that the firetv has difficulty with ghz networks that are set to auto channel selection and are utilizing channel numbers above the tech support person said i should change the channel to   or  instead of automatic and it workedbluetooth audio and video are out of sync with showtime netflix sling plex and hulu its fine through speakers but video lags slightly behind the audio using bluetooth audio and video are in perfect sync with bluetooth and amazon prime video which makes me think itll be fixed at some point as amazon provided video demonstrates it can work well in that regardgotta say i prefer the platform agnostic ui of roku with amazonworld tucked away in an app the firetv navigation pane represents mostly amazon products with no option to modify it rokus ui is more about the media less about the provider voice search works well if you want only to be presented with amazons viewing options for some reason i thought search was universal but only movies and tv shows available through amazon show up bummer the firetv is ok less than i was expecting and with other good options around the corner im beginning to doubt my choice,2.0,negative

so i purchased a pack of these a month ago dec and was using them as expected when i hit a snag at least  batteries from this pack were marginalundervoltage v out of the box i found this out because i had replaced a pair of batteries in one of my remote sensors for my wall mounted indoor weather station because the had sensor stopped working i thought maybe i had inserted them wrong but no the  marks matched the batteries so i tried several times to reset both the sensor and the station with no luck at one point i had all of the batteries out to force a reset and put them back but now my weather station would not power up eitherthat was the clue i needed i got my trusty multimeter with battery tester and checked out all  of the amazon basics aa cells like all new v batteries most of them showed v which is typical two of them were at v which was just low enough for them to be considered undervoltage no new aa battery should arrive with v this is the first and only time i have ever seen fresh batteries arrive in a not as new condition with caused problems with my electronicsi generally like all of the various amazon basics products mice hdmi cables etc but this has caused me to have doubts about not only their aa batteries but all of the house branded products buyer beware caveat emptor seems to be the bottom line,2.0,negative

we are very disappointed in the quality of amazons aa batteries they have failed  or  times in various products we own the most costlywas its use in our small wall safe in our home the  batteries failed after two months and we had to have a service open it at the tune of another example was a radio and flashlights we will have to throw the rest out,2.0,negative
maybe i had higher expectationin general i will not recommend since the service of amazon solving situations is not as good as in other products ive had so much troubles with the amazon free time i am even not longer using it it was one of the big features on the advertisment i will recommend to look for other alternatives before to take a decision on buying this product,2.0,negative
i received this as a christmas gift i was excited about this new product and downloaded the alexa app i am not an amazon prime member and i did not joined the free trial i asked questions to my alexa and it usually did not provide any answers or couldnt understand my questions despite giving simple commands the device looks good and the led light on top that turns on when you speak to it is great sound is good for music however i did not feel that it was a good assistant i did not like that you have to download skills to make alexa have more function you always had to speak alexa and then ask the skill you downloaded it then gets to a point that you dont even remember what skills you downloaded so you always had to look at your phone or mobile device to see what you had i exchanged it for the google home and it has been a better device it plays music from google music and not only music that you have purchased it answer a lot of questions and gives you great news briefing instead of downloading the particular skills it also provides more answers to questions and i was surprise by the detail of the answer at time i highly recommend to google home device i have not tested it with chromecast smart tv or with smart home appliances such as nest etc,2.0,negative

despite what seems to be a great deal for a pack of aa batteries these arent great  stars only because of the deal as theyre for light use i use them only for my xbox controllers i understand that the life is different with gaming sucking up all the energy but ive put a pair in before and about  weeks later had to change them not to mention i have  controllers one has a grip so i switch between them often this means they should last longer since im not just draining the battery life on one of them overall not great for gaming or heavy use otherwise theyre nice backups ill have to compare these to say duracell but from past experience i dont remember having to change them so often,2.0,negative

amazon seems to have changed the manufacturer of this battery i liked it very much the last year but the new one has a different look has noticeably lower capacity and leaks batteries usually leak after they die but these leaked while they were still good and apparently died because of the leak all of my devices have battery monitored one day they were good with  power left and they died suddenly the next day the leaks were mostly minor but clearly noticeable from body discolorationone thing that has not changed from before is the packaging and it is still bad they are shrinkwrapped  in a package and they are hard to open as there is no cutout or pulltab to break the wrap it is difficult to break open by hand twisting the package causes undue stress to the batteries and that may be cause of the leak i have had to use scissors or knife to cut open the package,2.0,negative

i am extremely disappointed with these batteries which stems not from longevity or power but with fit almost immediately upon receiving them i installed them into three electric candles no joy i cleaned the contacts still no joy i tested the batteries full charge just for grins i installed into one candle three rayovac brand batteries and the candle lit with no problem removed the rayovacs installed the amazons and again no joy i repeated this a couple of times with the same results and i tried this in the other two candles with identical results all three candles lit with the rayovacs none with the amazons knowing the issue was not with candles i took a rayovac and lined it up with an amazon and discovered something interesting the batteries were just a wee bit differentthe length of the positive terminals are different just a tad longer on the rayovac see picture the rayovac terminal is taller longer while the amazon terminal is squattier and therefore shorter the difference in length is tiny no question but when youre putting batteries into a rather cheap device to start with that tiny bit of length in this case seems to be the difference between one battery forming a sufficient connection and the other one not ill keep the amazons to use in devices mice for example that are likely more solidly built than these candles and have a greater connection tolerance or a stronger spring to hold the battery firmly in place i am concluding that when replacing batteries in an older device that may not force as firm a connection or in a cheapo device that may not hold batteries tightly from the getgo use a brandedname batteryi am a longtime and extremely satisfied user of amazon basic computer cables among their first products in the basics line but was recently disappointed with another item i purchased outside of the computer connectors and cables line that being dog housetraining piddle pads which have not proven as absorbent as similarlypriced products and ive bought a lot of different brands the batteries were my second foray into basics product lines outside of the ohsodependablecables arena and now im  for  in the disappointed column i never thought there was a difference in batteries and now i know differently the next time i see a duracell commercial emphasizing reliability and dependability ill think back to this experience as i will when selecting batteries in the future i so wanted to like these amazon batteries too,2.0,negative

i dont want to get too negative on this because it does what its supposed to however im not sure how amazon justifies charging  half that and id feel a lot less disappointed its nothing like the last generation cover which was hefty and substantial that thing could take a beating this one ummnot so muchpros i really like the solution amazon came up with to lock the kindle in place sort of a rubberized cup that grips it on all four sides and holds it very securely no more metalprong sliderelease gizmo it looks quite nice and is genuine if untextured leather like the last onecons flimsy the leather is extremely thin and unpadded wont stand up to much abuse scrape it even lightly on a rough surface and youll likely ruin it the actual cover that folds over the front is incredibly floppy and delicate  its about the thickness of a piece of notepad cardboard i could bend it in half with almost no effort if i had the notion cover has no lockclosure mechanism like the elastic strap on the last gen model it should have somethingoh well it is what it is i never read with the kindle in the case anyway so its not such a big deal to me but i was expecting more especially for this price,2.0,negative

my initial impression of this was very good the material is nicer than the shiny stuff on my hama cd binders and the netting trim gives a nice appearance compared to plain look of most budget cd bindersthere are  pages with  disc pockets each  per side giving a total of  capacity the pages are hung from the spine in two groups of  by that i mean that  pages all have a single attachment point to the plastic spinethis is where the first problem with this binder lies because each group of  pages shares the same anchor point in the spine the pages cannot sit flat once full of discs they bend and arch and apart from looking tatty this puts a lot of tension across the plastic film with longterm usage i suspect this plastic film will will tear due to the tension it also makes it awkward to browse the binder as the pages dont sit flat it may even crack or bend your discsi look to my hama  binder to see how it should be done  it only has  pages and yet they were smart enough to hang them from the spine in  bundles of  this spreads out the pages and allows easy browsing of the binder without putting any of the pockets under tensionafter just  weeks in storage i opened the binder and the corners of all the pages have become dogeared by themselves this is due to the poor design and poor fit of the binder pages when filled with discs again it is not a problem i have seen with my other disc binders my twoyearold hama binders look as good as newoverally this binder has a lot of storage at a good price if thats all you want you will probably be happy with the product but sloppy design prevents it from being anything more than a mediocre binder i feel that whoever designed this did not bother to fill it with discs to see how it would cope,2.0,negative

this is definitely not an ipad or a high end tablet nevertheless for the discounted price that i paid on it so less than  it is well worth getting i wanted something bigger while waiting for the next ipad air to come out and this fits the bill for paying little and getting a basic low end tablet it is geared towards amazon media consumption ad it does that decently even with a screen resolution less than hd if the sale comes back again where it is  off i would not hesitate to recommend it again,3.0,neutral

bought this for christmas  after about  months the battery began to fail to hold a charge while the first  months were good  as many of the reviews here laud this tablet  the  day warranty is disappointing from amazon when i did have a different amazon device fail within the warranty period their exchange was immediate and easy for a brand new device  so the only warranty issue is with the lengthid recommend it if you just want a cheap tablet to throw in your bag but otherwise its just average,3.0,neutral

the kindle is better than the older version in the fact that i have used it a lot with game apps for the kids and it was bogged down with memory being used up but i held out on purchasing a new one the scores and in app purchases wont transfer to the new one so i got the new one and it works fast updates apps camera is not so good but all and all  stars,3.0,neutral

id say for the price it was a decent tablet it did what i needed it to do but the support id say through the app side was a bit rather weak which is the big downfall of this tablet amazon also does a lot of advertisements on the tablet for example the lock screen and multiple pages on your home screens which can be rather annoying and unremoveable otherwise i used it to watch videos surf the web and use a few social media apps good for kids too both videos and games side so id say in general for the price its a decent tablet but if you are looking to do more and have a smoother tablet you might want to pay more for something better,3.0,neutral

an okay reader reading from an ipad mini is better under all conditions except outside in sunlight plus with the ipad you can play games web search etc the kindle library function is not nearly as good as the kindle app on the ipad where you can see many more of your books on a page and scroll through them all quickly versus the slow swipe function of the kindle i also do not like the page turn of the kindle versus apple every page turned on kindle is like slow motion and about every fifth page refreshes entirely i actually have to go to the top of the next page slowly in order to not have to wait for the kindle slow page turn even the reading in the outdoors feature of the kindle is not as great as reviewers indicate as there is still the sun glare on pages that you have to deal with although at least you can read with it outdoors the kindle also suffers from a shadow along the bottom of the screen the explanation is that it is actually a shadow that is between the lights that are shining upward for night time reading draw your own conclusions as to whether that is good engineering it is worse on some of the devices i saw than on others kindle serves the purpose for reading at the beach and not worrying if it accidently gets damaged i would never take an ipad to the beach but the kindle is almost disposable in contrast maybe  stars is being a bit generous but it is a good supplement to the ipad if apple ever makes their device so it can be used outside without a glare then i dont see any market for the kindle at that point not sorry i have a kindle but for what i decided to buy it for reading at beach it is at the price point where it is not really worth it i still read paper books for those who remember what those are and those still work perfectly for beach reading,3.0,neutral

its a decent tablet but keep the following in mind if you get this for your kids to share your amazon prime account for video and game apps you have to lock it to prevent accidental purchases problem is that this prevents free app and video purchases and you have to okay every thing they do  if you allow them access to apps and video then that can purchase anything without limitson top of this they lock out the google app store and refuse to even allow access to google drive while you can hack it to add these basic features you will need a modicum of technical knowledge to do soso its useful but a pain too your needs may vary,3.0,neutral

pro relatively inexpensive although i did end up waiting almost two weeks for deliverycons high dropout rate they come in packs of four when used in nikon cameras its not uncommon to find after an hour of use that three of the cells have dropped to v while the fourth has dropped tov they come out of the box within a hundredth of a volt of each other so im guessing that either the electrochemistry is highly variable from cell to cell or theres a interesting failure mode under load,3.0,neutral
overall for an alexa product it does the same thing as all the other ones this one is specifically portable and only needs to be put on the base for charging the one main issue is that it is not voice activated meaning it does not listen to you unless you press any of the buttons on top or the mic button in front by having this feature i could see it causing excess battery usage needs to be able to apps better,3.0,neutral

you will find detailed reviews of kindle paper white online i will cover some other general observationsif you send a pdf to your kindle email  it will sync it to your kindle but the fonts appear small when you open it in kindle paper white and the menu option did not allow me to change font size you have to convert the pdf to be able to adjust font sizeyou will be able to convert your existing pdfs by sending a email with convert in subject line and including the attachment and sending it to your kindle email refer to amazon settings for finding out your kindle email however it may lose the tables or other code diagrams from the original pdf so that is a pain varies from pdf to pdf also if you are used to ios or android the page turns are not the same like flipping when you tap or perform a page flipit will blink for a sec and refresh the page to move to next page i found this a little annoying but it works if you buy a book online then that might be a better option as it will let you read the formatted content correctlybattery usage is fantasticanother positive is that the inbuilt lights are not glaring in the dark so you will find reading to be a pleasant experience they have settings to adjust brightness as well,3.0,neutral

for the price the tablet works well the biggest issue ive had is the battery life length the battery seems to not last as long as my previous ipad mini,3.0,neutral
i ended up returning this tablet for the price  the tablet performed very well however if you have the money do yourself a favor and step out of the amazon lineup the ipads are great in my opinion the best but they cost  from what ive experienced the samsung tab a line is a solid tablet for a  budget you can often find one on sale for  and its a pretty good bangforthe buckif the money is your only concern then this will probably work well enough for you,3.0,neutral
this product is great for reading you the news a book or the weather alexa is great at setting timers and alarms and telling silly jokes if you ask alexa a google type question such as what was the score to such and such college basketball game most times she cannot answer even if you pose the question a number of ways sometimes you can ask a question differently from the way you would intuitively ask a question and alexa will answer this proves frustrating to me it is a very expensive gadget that your phone can easily do with a few keystrokes i am considering returning it and purchasing the google product to see if there is an improvement,3.0,neutral
too slow for games and videos i bought it for my youngest son so they wouldnt fight for the ipad but they still do,3.0,neutral
these batteries are only ok they dont last as long as duracell and when they die its usually instantly one moment they seem to work fine the very next moment they are outputting half power i would say that about half of these batteries just simply died while being used no warning no gradual loss of power simply dead they also seem to be marginally shorter than brandname batteries but to be honest i havent measured them suffice it to say ive decided that i would rather spend the few extra cents per battery on brandname batteries its simply not worth the savings in my opinion ive had similar experience with dollar store batteries,3.0,neutral
i purchased these for the office as everyone has an apple mouse that uses aa batteries i found myself changing batteries on my mouse almost every month with these batteries yes they work but not for long we purchased these in september and we blew through these in  months with  employees with duracell batteries which i purchased again they last much longer several months instead of just one month,3.0,neutral

decent tabletperforms ok you really get what you pay fordo not expect anything special with this tablet it works does what its meant to do and nothing more having a prime subscription is a must but not a requirement to take full advantage of this tablet its pretty much an amazon portal for all the services they offer great for my son streaming his shows like sesame street pbs etc netflix works fine as well,3.0,neutral

this kindle is great for the price however there are some downsides to paying for a  tablet the battery life goes very quickly so daily charges are necessary if youre a heavy reader you also cant save anything of merit like books or magazines to a minisd card thus making a purchase of one a waste of time and money,3.0,neutral
ive had my thea for three months so far and it is amazing except for some recent issues the problem is now its breaking after only three months and i have no clue why it wont charge anymore and it isnt vibrating on full power im hoping that nymph will send me a replacement considering the lifetime guarantee im kind of upset at how fast it broke though despite how good of a condition i tried to keep it in,3.0,neutral
this is not as cheap feeling as i thought it was going to be its definitely not in the ipad class but its not bad for what it is i ordered online and did not have one in my hands until mine arrived pros the screen is decent sound is loud enough for me no lag scrolling and real racing  plays smoothly cons the major down side is battery charging time battery life and built in storage space when it arrived it was showing  remaining after less than  hours use it had to be charged i just read where it can take  hours or longer to charge my ipad air  can fully charge in a few hours from  built in storage is not enough yes you can get micro sd cards however some apps will only install on the built in storage also you can not delete amazon apps without voiding the warranty and unless im missing something you cant move them eitherso if you are looking for something to use casually for web surfing email watching movies reading books and the occasional game this should be just finekeeping in mind the battery life and lack of built in storage but you wont be doing any serious work on this like you can on the ipads but to be fair this is  the price of my ipad air  and  the cost of an ipad mini  but i dont believe its meant to be a direct ipad competitor because if it were it would fail miserably,3.0,neutral

i like amazonbasics products so i was excited to see these batteries to find out if they were a good value i looked up data online bottom line for flashlights toys and steady drain devices youll be better off buying rayovac alkalines here on amazon for cameras and photo flashes duracell coppertops will be betterheres why rayovacs cost a little bit more per battery but they hold more energy than these amazonbasics batteries as a result the final price per amount of power is about the same you just wont have to change batteries as oftenthose rayovacs work best in steady drain devices but not so well in cameras or flashes for those high drain devices duracell coppertops hold up better and end up being cheaperbattery ninja tested these amazonbasics aas in toothbrushes i did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power mwh but that they do not carry as much energy as others the test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others at least in the toothbrushes there were no test results vs digital cameras photo flashes or toys so im extrapolating that these will perform like rayovacs not like duracell coppertopsso the only data to compare here is the toothbrush test for energy delivered these amazonbasics batteries cost about the same as rayovac batteries but will die sooner to say that another way these batteries cost less but also deliver less powerboth rayovac and amazon basics are better than energizer batteries which appear to consistently give less power and still cost more i guess the money goes to the energizer bunnyduracell coppertops will last longer in flashlights toys and toothbrushes but cost a little bit more per unit of power mwh on the other hand they hold up better in cameras and similar electronics theyre probably the best all around battery so if you dont like changing batteries and a willing to spend a tiny bit more coppertops are a good way to gofinally the best value battery is interesting it is the costco kirkland signature battery ninjas results show that and so do the tests from consumer reports you can buy those costco batteries here on amazon but the price is higher than youd get at the club of course im not a costco member so it doesnt matter to me but buying them here on amazon is not a good value,3.0,neutral

sound quality is pretty good if you want it to play background music but i still prefer sonos for this purpose alexa is useful for controlling the widest range of smart home products but its not backed by google homes superior search intelligence so it isnt that great for asking indepth questions of it there are comparisons of these products out there so take a look before making a decision since i mostly wanted it for home control it suits my need,3.0,neutral
loved the price but i found myself replacing them more quickly in items like the wall clocks and the remote controls i like having a box of replacement batteries on hand in the house so these are fine for emergencies but i might want to invest in a brand that lasts a bit longer for things like smoke detectors or flashlights,3.0,neutral

i decided i wanted to try a tablet for reading books and a little social media instead of using my phone all the time i researched the fire  and fire hd  and settled on the  knowing that it is a low end device the device is slick and easy to use and the alexa integration is really cool but its a  tablet at times the performance is awful slow i suspect it is updating content say on twitter or fb my complaint is when it is doing this there are no visuals to let you know it is busy i finally got on amazons chat feature and several hours later including several power cycles and a complete factory restore the performance is the same the reps at amazon tried their best  and fwiw i knew there was nothing they could do to speed it up before i contacted them but i thought i would give it a try so get this if you want just be patient remember its a  tablet if you want better performance spend more ,3.0,neutral

although i had a roku three that did most of what i needed playstation vue isnt available but it is available on the fire tv if you have a prime membership this is probably for you if you are one of the people that dont like me this is nothing but a way for amazon to get you to buy more stuff from them you cant set the menus to only show the content that you own and the apps that you have downloaded cant be put first on the list,3.0,neutral
i bought this expecting the same quality i have received in the previous  kindles i purchased i am disappointed i like the price the home screen is just all the apps right in your face not just the ones you want like in the older version kindle fire i mostly use it for reading books and so far im dissatisfied its great to swipe to the next page but when i want to go to settings or something else while reading i find it difficult to open instead the page just turns and by the time i finally get to the book settings ive lost my spot i downloaded the facebook app and its very slow maybe its amazons way of telling me thats what i get for  but come on sometimes i like to use the kindle to search the web and that too is slow i compared it to my older version and there is a noticible difference in speed i know there are other cool user tools but for me i mostly use it to read and check facebook and maybe pinterest its priced well if you want it for kids its user friendly and my kids have already figured out all the options i would recommend it for kids or for people who are technologically not savvy,3.0,neutral

if you enjoy music do not buy you cannot send a bluetooth signal out to an external speaker she is not as smart as siri and answers basic basic questions i deal with it because i bought the wemo fixtures for lights and switches and she works fine with those i would recommend the echo dot if you would like to make her louder or like music loud,3.0,neutral
the echo is a great product if you have money to burn and tech savvy alexa echo learns as you talk to it and ask questions you have to go online and enable different skill sets to allow alexa to answer more questions as for operating smart devices this cannot happen wirhout a huge expense you have to purchase wifismart bulbs and switches before she can operate one smart switch or wifi bulb can cist as much as  thats pretty steep to me on occasion alexa will begin talking when no one has called her to respond,3.0,neutral

so i love love love eink im not even a big reader but ts this magic technology that no one seems excited about there is literally ink inside the screen that moves up or down electronically so it is literally an actual printed book page that can change in an instancei like the kindle paperwhite and it does everything i need but this particular version doesnt have the same pleasing page color as my  year old kindle which is strange but i really needed the light to actually be able to read when i usually want to read so when the light is on its pretty nicethe interface is rather slow which is to be expected given its not a traditional lcd screen its literally a printing press but i wish the interface had better ways to organize and change the order of books the other problem i had was that the first one i received had a large hole in the upper layer of the screen where the light diffuses through so it had this glowing hole that reminded me of a giant stuck pixel also there were a few random stuck black spots the next one did not have these problems amazon will replace it for you if it does,3.0,neutral

fire worked fine and was simple to set up i must add however that the overview menu should have more than a few online locations apps like netflix and youtube it should work as a main menu whose apps include things like livetv discplayer and even phonograph instead it is pretty much allamazon at least if it was easy to access it was amazon aliza was not all that helpful either for nonamazon material certainly not for tv shows that are not in the amazon library i think it is a mistake to make me change source to access almost anything but amazon i was spoiled by my previous old sony bluray disc player that did indeed act like a central menu for everything  including amazon i may be showing my age and ignorance here but i bet i have lots of company i say kiss for usage even if it means a more complicated install,3.0,neutral

works great until i had forgotten that amazon fire did not come with google playstore i looked up how to add playstore to the  fire there are many videos on youtube that showed how to add playstore to the fire all seemed to add it ok but the loss performance of the fire was noticeable there were several apps that failed to work at all or lost features one example was lifetime it was slow to load and failed to bring up chromecast one reason i hoped for this app would work was my samsung and vizio smart tvs dont offer this app i found a old tablet i had forgotten i had i loaded lifetime and works perfect i guess what it boils down to it you are after apps on the playstore get a non amazon tablet it is just easier to use apps should work and you dont have to fool around trying to adapt playstore if playstore isnt critical then im sure this a a great little table,3.0,neutral

bought this to replace my aging nexus   version but didnt hold a candle up to it i knew it going in but wanted to see for myself in person for  cant hardly beat the features but i was spoiled by arguably the best small android tablet ever made i knew the screen resolution was lacking especially on an  screen but coming from the nexus it was a huge difference also even at  plus years old the processor was humming along smoothly the extra  gb ram was also helpful anyways back to the fire hd  one advantage it had over the nexus was the expansion slot i loved being able to put my media on it but then again the media displayed on the screen was subpar so its a wash i installed google play on it so that it expanded its functionality and im an avid amazon conneseiur but found the table too limiting ultimately returned and bought an old discontinued fire hd  for  the resolution almost matches that of the nexus so im happy for now,3.0,neutral

let me set the stage for this review i joined a book club this year and have started reading a lot or at least what i would consider to be a lot which is about  decentlylong books a monthup until buying the paperwhite i was doing most of my reading on my iphone using the kindle app long story short i ended up returning the paperwhite after about  weeks why because i realized just how sporadic my reading was i read when im out and about waiting at a doctors office or inline at a restaurant etc it became overwhelmingly apparent to me that the best ereader is the one you have with you at all times for me thats my iphonethe actual reading experience is definitely better on the paperwhite however if youre an onthego reader like me then it just means you have to carry around another device dedicated ereaders are for people who either truly read a ton or have a set routine for reading if thats not you then stick with your phone,3.0,neutral

if you are looking for something to help you keep more organized or keep you up to date with weather markets and the latest news the amazon echo show is what you are looking for honestly the product is top of the line technology and is easy to use as long you are patient and work with it and read the directions the size of it is truly perfect it honestly reminds me of the size of normal alarm clock that would have on a nightstand and with that it truly can serve that purpose it also has a touch screen and i feel it is very durable and can stand to last the sound quality is also superb with dual inch speakers it has bluetooth capabilities as well but it only works with android samsung fire os ios device excluding mac products the echo show comes in two colors black and white the product has many different features and functions and they can accommodate pretty much anyoneäôs needs the top feature is the alexa app which is an application in which you can call commands and ask it questions about most anything then i believe the music capabilities are truly amazing and how you can ask it to play almost any song or playlist whenever you want also you can tell it to volume up or down as well another new modernized technology it has is the capability to do hands free voice command smart home options a couple things that could be improved is sometimes that it does not fully hear your exact words and it will search for something you arenäôt expecting the other function it could have is it could have single voice recognition to only several voices so then you donäôt have the entire room trying to mess with it constantly the price is also fair as well for its creative capabilities it has so if you are trying to find some new technology to add to your home the echo show would be a great addition for you,4.0,positive

i was pleasantly surprised that i have enjoyed the kindle fire this was my first ever use of buying books on kindle due to summer courses i was taking at the time in mayjune  what i liked kindle books synched on macbook and fire tablet very helpful when it came time to write my papers the highlights i made while i read the book on the tablet synched to the version i read on the macbook desktop this helped a ton especially with things like formatting the footnotes watching videos cool little feature while you watch a video you can tap the screen and it will list the actors who are currently one the screen  amazon shopping i can now understand peoples amazon shopping addictionsl i will give it to amazon this tablet became my gateway to using prime and countless hours of online browsing prior to this i rarely purchase items online i can see how they have made it so easy across platforms  portability i like that i will bring this with me for my general online browsing and reading needs rather than having to use my laptop or my phone what i did not like signon screen adsthere is no way to turn them off i suppose for  depending if you purchased on a sale the advertisers are subsidizing the cost of the tablet however i wished this was stated as a feature before purchasing it i may have paid the money and upgraded to the next kindle if i had known it could not be turned off  turning offstandby mode this took some time to get used to rather than an issue when you turn the tablet off it is really on a standby mode so the batteries will drain you have to hold the button a little longer and make sure it is turned off  weather app i dont know if this is just my tablet the weather app does not update as soon as you open it it takes minutes if at all to update with the current weather i have not been able to find in any forums if other people are experiencing the same issue i have instead downloaded and used other weather apps but at this point the app is worthless  screen resolution its not the best but i got used to it for reading and occasional video viewing purposes it is sufficient  screen dimmerblue light mode i read and use the tablet at night and have gotten sensitive to the brightness of the tablet screen and the systems default dimmer and blue light feature is awful the blue light app allows you to set the color tone however it is so orange it makes it unreadable the app i use instead is called bluelight blocking and even dimming the brightness with the slider was still too bright for me so i have had to download the app dimly so be able to set the brightness,4.0,positive

this fire tv is a better choice than the fire stick from a connectivity standpoint if you have a lan connection or if you have potential wireless connections it also has the advantage of expandable storage although ive not found a need for it yet as with the newest apple tv the fire tv uses a graphic intensive interface although the fire tv doesnt have the apples volume control selection is somewhat more reliable than the touch pad interface used by apple the only thing keeping this from  stars is the way amazon chooses to organize the selections all in all the fire tv is the best way to take advantage of your amazon prime membership,4.0,positive

amazon echo is a smart home device but its not quite as smart as google home it also doesnt integrate with your smartphone as anything more than a mediocre bluetooth speaker i dont care about ordering products from amazon using my voice and i wish alexa would answer my more obscure questions like google doeswhere the echo shines right now though is with smart home integration i use the echo to control my philips hue lights and control all of my home theater devices through my harmony hub and soon full control over my dish hopper through a dishamazon partnership its a bit more expensive than i would have liked and i ended up adding an echo dot to the other room so i didnt have to yell for alexa to hear mein hindsight if you dont need a mediocre bluetooth speaker get the echo dot instead which you can hook to speakers of your own choice,4.0,positive

i had this device for few weeks before returning it and getting the kindle voyage but the only difference between the two is the design page press buttons and the auto dimming light as they both have the same screen after purchasing this device i immediately devoured three books in the course of a weekend which sadly is more than ive read in about two years this device has reinvigorated my live for reading since it is so portable and the battery lasts for quite a while i would suggest that you get the genuine leather cover for this device when you buy it as it just adds that little extra to the purchase overall i would recommend anyone that wants to read more reads often or reads many books at once to take the plunge and buy this device plus new books can be upwards of  sometimes this little device will carry all of your books and only costs the price of a few hard copy books plus if you need a physical copy you can always borrow from the library,4.0,positive

theyre batteries theyre cheaper than walmart what more could you want i dont have stats on whether they last longer than duracell or energizer but at this price i dont think it really matters the brand amazon basics has tons of useful stuff all the way from batteries to laptop bags and more it seems like amazon wasnt enough of a household name so theyre trying to make it so everything in your house has the amazon name on it but i aint mad let them take over i just wish they had an amazon basics brand for disposable diapers,4.0,positive

i was attracted by the price of the base kindle but in the end opted for the paperwhite as it was illuminated and had rounded edges which felt more comfortable definitely worth the extra few dollars in my opinion my local library offers free loans of ebooks which i have been taking advantage of there are also many free books online  samples and classics with expired copyrights battery life is good and the device is lightweight even in bright ambient light you get minimal screen glare i prefer this to a physical book which i never expected,4.0,positive

these arent the greatest batteries but they work weve found that they work best in computer accessories like a keyboard or mouse but do not last long in things like toy remote controlled cars anything that takes a big drain in short bursts off of them like electric toy car motors shortens the life of these batteries fast but things that only use a small amount of energy over a long period of time do a lot better some name brand batteries do very well with high drain electronics and last a lot longer than these but if you use these amazon batteries on low draw electronics youll get your moneys worthwhat ive found them good for keyboard mouse laser pointer small led flashlights small noise making toys plays music electronic beepsnot good for anything with an electric motor toy cars pencil sharpener etcthey can be a good value depending on what you use them to power,4.0,positive

you have to purchase the power outlets light switches and other things for alexa to communicate with once you do and setup them up it works pretty well you have to be careful if you put it near the tv where they might do a commercial or a story about it on the news alexa has pretty good hearing and perks up when she hears her name over all easy to set up with the app and works pretty well takes some time getting used to asking alexa to turn on or off the lights and not just reaching for the light switch,4.0,positive

i have an old kindle touch the last one that still had texttovoice which no longer works i decided to upgrade started reading the reviews was enticed by the the kindle voyage and took the plunge the voyage is pretty and sleek with neat features and i enjoyed using it for a few days but my frugal self just couldnt justify the price difference between it and the paperwhite while the ambient light sensor was nice i often ended up just adjusting it manually because it was still a little bright in a completely dark room i made more errors of turning a page than i meant to with the page turn because of where the page turn spots are located plus im in the habit of flipping pages on the phone or a tablet so i kept swiping despite the availability of page turn however the clarity of the screen the quality of the light the form factor the weight and the way it felt in my hand while reading were all very nice nonetheless the price difference bothered me enough to return it and get the paperwhite the thing i miss most about the voyage is the quality of the light and how even the lighting is on it the unit i had did not have blank spots or a yellowish top half of the page or any of the lighting issues some reviewers mentioned with the voyage i purchased the newest model of the paperwhite and i like it but the lighting appears pretty dingy however its only when theyre compared sidetoside that i wished i wasnt so cost conscious if money is not an object id say get the kindle voyage if it is the paperwhite is a fine little reader and overall im happy i have it,4.0,positive

pros  a beefy machine for the price great battery management in standby a solidly built android tab at a rock bottom price cons proprietory amazon user interface may be irritating but this is a personal preference the app selection is limiting but you can install google play and get all you need from there  brightness and resolution may not be the greatest but completely usable  a compromise for the low price had some wifi issues on several occasions compatibility issues it is a little weak also may be a bit small and aspect ratio is a bit weird long an narrowoverall a reasonable tab that does the job done not many games though for a minimal investment,4.0,positive

if you like to read books i totally recommend this product i love reading books and the kindle paperwhite really helps i used to read books on the ipad all the time but it would strain my eyes after reading all the reviews i decided it was finally time to get a ereader since i had my ipad already i just needed one to strictly read books so i got the paperwhite it is so nice to read from especially in the sun its almost like reading from the actual book its the perfect size to read in one hand and stores so many books even some for my child its also great for traveling i have all my books on hand no matter where i go  there are only two cons to the paperwhite one is that the touch screen is not that receptive as compared to an ipad at times it doesnt register my swipes or taps the other con is that its only black and white it really isnt a problem when im reading just for the childrens books,4.0,positive
this isnt the best tablet but for casual gaming youtubing the price was perfect for this tablet on black friday,4.0,positive

or at least a future id like to be living in lets get this straight as a prime member you can get this for  at that rate think of it as a wireless speaker that you can just issue spoken instructions to an alarm clock that you can shout at alexa shut up in the morning and it will obey you  its my half asleep morning power trip set a timer for when youre cooking fact check your friend while you argue with them pso my common use cases aside heres what is good about echo speech recognition works really well esp for brief phrases it can hear you from pretty much anywhere in the room and is pretty accurate with the wake word ive been using alexa as a music player its really nice to be able to just ask for a song by name and have it just come up without having to hunt through a playlist connect to the bluetooth speaker etc purchasing music is pretty seamless as if amazon needed another way to get you to spend money  iheart radio integration if youre into that kinda thinghere is what is not so great speech recognition for longer phrases needs a couple of attempts maybe because of my accent eg alexa play the song the troubles by u as a music player its a bit lacking in bass sometimes while its playing music you have to use the wake word once or twice to gets its attention bing search really rolls eyesid love to see in the future integration with fire tv so that i can simply say alexa play the sopranos on my tv google search being able to send a message to a friend in my contacts alexa message xyz blah blah blahoverall its a pretty cool product and id love to see what it looks like over time,4.0,positive

would give it a  star if the battery lasted as long as they claim but its worth the extra charging times for the nice design so light and easy in your hand especially without the cover but using the cover is comfortable as well the leather cover smells a bit when it arrives but i let it air out for a few days before using it and now its fine nice quality leather and i love the merlot color the page turn buttons are easier to use than the buttons on the voyage screen looks the same even though they claim there are more backlights on this one im very happy with my oasis,4.0,positive
okay so i have been debating for days on whether to rate this thing  or  stars and i still want to rate it  and a half but i have settled for  stars here is whyprosthe only real reason i wanted this case over the others is because every other case holds the kindle in with straps around the edges and this is the only case that holds the kindle in while letting you see the whole front side it holds it in perfectly neither feeling loose or too tight to get it out the black leather is genuine leather and smells nice and while the front cover is very thin if you tap on it you get a hollow drum sound and it can be bent without much effort it takes mild amounts of abuse without a problem also the flap folds back perfectly and when you are reading you hardly notice the kindle has a case onconsmy main complaint is the quality of the leather if you compare this to the case for the kindle  keyboard the leather is a little thinner but much less durable i sometimes lightly hold my kindle between my teeth when i run out of hands and after a week i can still see my tooth marks whereas on the k case i couldnt also even a mild scratch will either take several days to disappear update most scratches will mostly disappear so its not as big a problem as i originally thoughtthe only other complaint is of course the lack of anything to hold the cover closed but this has actually not been much of a problem for me quite often i like to frisbee toss my kindle onto a nearby soft surface like carpet or a pillow or bed and i was afraid the cover would flap open every time but  times out of the  i tried it stayed shut just fineread more,4.0,positive

bestbuy was offering some discounts during thanksgiving and this prompted me to buy i was not an avid before and just casually bought this product but i must admit i am not at all disappointed with this works best with english books does not work that well with native books also this product is not backlit and does not have any option to increase the screen brightness and i would deduct  star for that you need to install another product called calibre in your computer to convert books to kindle readable format mobi kindle can also read pdf but mobi format is better readable compared to kindle,4.0,positive

i have owned kindles for many years and have always been very happy with their portability performance and ease of use the highly expandable memory is what lead me to purchase this kindle for my son there are only two areas that i am very disappointed the first in the parental control settings in order to ensure that my son cannot make endless onetouch purchases and i mean oneeasy little touch i must set the controls either off or on the problem with this is that he then has no internet access or extremely limited access so limited that he cannot access content i normally allow him to accessbig problem now amazon is pretty good about refunding unintended app purchases there is a cancel button but then you must wait days or more for the refund to be credited this is an issue that i am getting more frustrated with as we move through time with this purchase the second issue amazons kindle app store is weak if you can find some of the apps that you are searching for they may not be entirely supported by the device such as facebooka major app and a major downfall to kindle use because of this last issue both my son and i have apple devices to supplement what we cannot do on our kindle all this being said however my son and i both very much enjoy what the kindles do have to offer so they get a good rating because of thishowever because of the issues i discussed it was difficult to choose between an average and good rating,4.0,positive

i waited to get this keyboard until i did a little bit of research and i think that made all the difference in the time it took me to do the research amazon had pushed out an update that fixed the bluetooth problem the keyboard had been having a lot of the onestar reviews are from people who bought the keyboard when this problem hadnt been solved yetthe keyboard itself has all the keys youd expect alphanumeric keys up down left and right keys and a few extra like keys for the volume and a home key that actually takes you to the carousel screen however there are a few curious omissions no page up or page down no delete key theres a backspace key but thats not the same thingthe keys are wellspaced and its not a problem touch typing on the keyboard its certainly not as spacious as a fullsized keyboard but its about the size of a keyboard on a smallish laptopthe one thing they could add that might make this keyboard close to perfect is a way to carry it its a perfect portable size but its not something i would want to store in a backpack i will probably keep the box it came in for travel purposes,4.0,positive

last got fire  for my kids with an amazon freetime subscription these are very good for the price with two flaws the screen is good and much better than other android devices at  but not great and got the  mb version with i would not recommend in hindsight because androids subpar management on sd cards got these this year it has a much better screen not only larger but with better resolution adequate speakers for its price its fast enough and overall more enjoyable to use  gb is the minimum id recommend even with sd cards because some apps just work better with internal storage and some apps even stored in sd will still use some amount of internal storageit also has alexa voice supportthe main reason for these tablets in my case is the freetime subscription that has unlimited access to thousands of ageappropriate books hundreds or thousand of free apps and heavily curved web access per age presets amazon fire os has a decent support for multiuser and in particular kids accounts my kids are  and  they spend a lot of time on games as expected but also read a good amount of books,5.0,positive

even when im outside in bright sunlight the words of the book im reading are still crystal clear that alone makes the kindle oasis worth what it cost methe kindle oasis wakes up in just seconds and any book i choose instantly opens ready to be readit is the perfect size and isnt heavy or bulky i really do read for hours at a time sometimes i pace the floor while i read sometimes im on my elliptical machine when i read and sometimes im sitting down no matter what im doing the kindle oasis remains comfortable to hold and it is always easy on my eyeswhen i receive a book that is in pdf most of the time i can enlarge the words if it wont allow me to enlarge the words i can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger i am able to make notes on the book if needed and i can highlight words andor passagesmy merlot leather cover is attractive when i flip it open it is just like opening the cover of a bookhow to make the battery laston the kindle oasis page it says that its dualbattery charging system delivers months of battery life this was a huge thing for me instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day i would be able to read for months without charging the kindleis this how my oasis has performed well not so much there are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your oasis to last for two monthsfirst you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day that one is impossible for me there are days that i am only able to read for thirty minutes but they dont occur very often my kindle goes everywhere with me and i use just about every spare moment to readsecond the wireless needs to be turned off that one is easy to do but not always easy to remember the only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more booksthird this is based on your light setting at  that is way too low for me i keep my light setting anywhere from  to i dont limit my reading to thirty minutes a day and i try to remember to keep my wireless turned off my light setting is kept anywhere from  to  and i put my kindle to sleep the second im done reading so how long does a single charge last me ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far but it would have kept a charge for several more days if i had remembered to turn my wireless off once i succeed in keeping my wireless off i will let you know how long the charge lastsnow i dont plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low i allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover i allow it to drain down to about  before i plug the cover and kindle into my computer to chargethe one thing that surprised me was that everything on the oasis is in black and white for some reason i thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color but since i bought the oasis to read books on color isnt neededspecial offers do appear on my screen but only when my kindle is going to sleep or waking up they arent a distraction and to be honest they are kind of fun to look at you can pay a higher price so they wont appear on your kindle if you would rather not see themi asked myself some questions once i had my kindle and knew just how it worked if i had known before i bought my kindle oasis that the charge wouldnt last for months would i still have bought it yes i would have if i had known that everything would appear in black and white would i still have bought it yes i would have,5.0,positive

i bought this tablet as a gift for my motherinlaw who is not very techsavvy she already owns a laptop but was interested in getting a tablet to use while watching tv rather than a whole laptop she also travels around quite a bit so having something light she could take with her was a big plus ive owned a couple amazon tablets before so i had an idea of how they worked and i wanted something at a low price point so i decided on this so far she loves it a couple of important pointsthe low price point comes at the cost of hardware after using my fire hdx this tablet felt just a little slow but not excessively so it performed better in basic tasks loading apps web browsing etc than i expected based on my experiences with other tablets at similar price pointsas an amazon tablet this runs a modified version of android but does not have bakedin access to google services including the google play store you will be restricted to amazonapproved apps unless you sideload apps on your own or are able to get access to google services yourself popular apps like netflix skype and facebook are all present but the selection pales in comparison to native android,5.0,positive

this is such a great deal that i opted for the battery package rather than spend the same amount on a pack of rechargeable aas at only  cents per aa cell it is less than the cost of x minutes of my labor associated with charging multiple rounds of rechargeables since i only have a bay charger if you need a sizeable number of batteries at once this deal is hard to beattheyre all meticulously packed in cell wrappers so you wont have  batteries rattling around and tipping over in a jumbled mess the entire line of amazonbasics products is impressivethese batteries are no exception i will definitely repurchase these,5.0,positive
not only does what siri does but it takes it one step further by completing tasks that you ask it to do like ordering pizza or ubers which i do plenty of with extra devices hooked to lights in your home for example you can ask echo to turn your lights on dim them etc before entering the home this can be a real safety feature,5.0,positive
