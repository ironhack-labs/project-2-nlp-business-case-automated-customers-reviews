it took me a long time to buy an ereader because i just love real books but i am happy i bought this and so far after a few months ive experienced none of the discoloration that other users have mentioned about previous versions very happy with it,5.0
this tablet shut down and never turned back on after a week of purchasing it i had to return it and they were out of stock for exchange annoying,1.0
we have had a number of tablets but non of them have been as user friendly as this one my son loves it and it is super easy for him to find his apps,5.0
these dont seem to last as expected,2.0
tablet was reasonably priced would say its a starter tablet for kids kind of slow on response but the kids enjoy it,3.0
bought this to keep all my ebooks on to carry in my purse so i could read when was stuck at the hospital etcwell gee the free wifi at the hospital has a signon screen couldnt get to that did some reading on my phone i think i can fix it the next time i need to be there just disappointed that it wouldnt allow the signon page to display right out of the box,4.0
works great would recommend for anyone looking for a good product very kid friendly,5.0
these are odd several times so far i have put them into some device and the circuit does not work so it seems dead tested the batteries with a tester and they read  volts so they are fully charged put in energizers duracells that show  volts and the device works perfectly tried one of each brand and got mixed results good price but ray o vacs are about the same and no problem i dont know what is wrong but for now i dont like them,2.0
i purchased this because have become a cord cutter and this was highly recommended by a good friend as a worthy streaming box i was pleasantly how fast and responsive it is and future proof with the added k functionality only downside is that it has a tremendous amount of amazon bloatware which i understand but it is constantly present,4.0
nice built tablet you need to note that it has amazon store and no google play store,3.0
these do not hold the amount of high power juice like energizer or duracell but they are half the price,3.0
bought these on amazon for a good price but they just dont seem to last very long the packaging and batteries look nice none of them leaked but that could be because i went through them so fast,3.0
great batteries my kids use them a lot for i dont know but i have use them they seem to last as long as the name brand i have no complaints i havent had one leak yet very good product,5.0
the best ereader that i have ever used i would recommend it,5.0
my child loves this tablet he is on it all day long wish youtube was easier to use though,4.0
once taking time to install google play store it functioned as good as any other android tablet the down side is camera which doesnt produce clear pictures,4.0
i have an older fire hd  and had started reading a lot more periodicals on it okay i admit it comic books so when the news about the fire hd  th generation went out i put in a preorder and eagerly anticipated its arrival so i could have just a slightly larger screen and better performancethe fire hd  delivered on those two fronts its noticeably snappier than my hd  and the screen is larger no arguing those pointsmy fire hd  arrived charged to  so i hooked it up to the included charger and set it to download some of the aforementioned periodicals i checked on it two hours later and noticed that it had managed a measly  increase in battery charge in that time starting at  i would have expected it to at least be in the mid to high s after two hoursafter experimenting a bit i found that the only way i could get a sort of decent charging speed was to turn the fire hd off altogether and let it charge with absolutely nothing else running i am now able to charge at a rate of about  every  to  minutes an improvement over  per half hour but it means having to fully turn off the fire hd before i plug it in and then restart it when i want to use it again the fire hd  will maintain an even charge level while it is plugged in and in use but dont expect it to replenish the battery in that stateaside from that the fire hd  seems a decent tablet for a  price point just dont expect it to fully charge overnight if you deplete it the day before,3.0
the show works great with my other products love it,5.0
the screen is too dark and cannot adjust the brightness,2.0
bought it for my son  wife they love it both thought they didnäôt need it they find that it is a lot of fun and very useful,5.0
loved it great product for my  year old son,3.0
works just fine,5.0
the internet server silk is not compatible with free wifi on southwest airlines and i bought it to use on the plane also i cannot hear the audio even with the sound all the way up on the plane so i dont really need it since i have a computer  iphone and kindle at home,2.0
affordable tablet for kids to use great deal,3.0
probably a fine item for most but i bought it for a specific application the best buy employee said it would work but unfortunately it didnt,2.0
not very long lasting batteries,2.0
i am satisfied the batteries i recieved are just as good as any other name brand batteries that you could buy,5.0
i love this device for my kids who are way too young to trust with a  tablet such as an ipad works efficiently my kids love it  i love the parental control features if something happens to it amazon handles it quickly  if it were to break or get lost its cheap to replace that being said it obviously doesnt hold a candle to samsung or apples tablets im not really a fan of the operating system,3.0
i got this for my  yr old son i was looking to get him the samsung tab  but this was a great deal less money it works for the things he does,3.0
dont know if its my camera or the batteries but they seem to run down pretty quickly,3.0
good basic tablet but already have troubles amazon sent a new one,3.0
perfect tablet for younger kids it is inexpensive so when they inevitably break it you will not be so mad,4.0
thanks great product,5.0
would not buy these again i reluctantly gave it a nd star because the price was good but the batteries are pretty much  star these get pretty good reviews so i was excited about them then the kids kept coming back way too fast asking for batteries for their wii remote it didnt make sense to me until i tossed some in my blood pressure monitor that thing runs for many months or years on a set of batteries but not these only weeks with these i dont have any kind of meter or anything like that to check them but the proof is in the usageits awful buy something else with a brand name,2.0
sticking to longer life energizers,3.0
easy to use enough apps for kids to enjoy for the price,4.0
i found this product let me let go of cable tv and saved me tons of money since i am on limited income i had to let cable go i kept my high speed internet and use my fire to watch movies and save tons of money,4.0
the earlier models were so simple to use no nonsense listing of books in its library by author or title now there are big pictures with tiny lettering and lots of ads,2.0
i really wanted to give this device a chance but i did end up returning it its a huge upgrade though over the cheaper  version honestly i dont think anyone should purchase that if your budget can handle getting this version and you are heavily invested in the amazon ecosystem ie prime member this will make a great tablet i think it is intended more for kids though than adults having ipads in the house we tried this with our toddler as a cheaper tablet for her but the interface and quirks of the amazon os just were not worth the hassle will end up seeking out a used ipad mini  instead of this,3.0
i only bought this as a travel companion when i fly it was cheap and functional,3.0
for the price it is worth it for below usd you get a decent tablet,5.0
wore out way to fast,1.0
the two main purposes i use the echo for are the flash news briefing and as a bluetooth speaker alexa isnt any more intuitive than siri or google assistant,4.0
i love this device it works so well and is easy on the eyes having on device hold all of my books and being able to get new books so easily is the best feature for someone like me who is an avid reader,5.0
these batteries worked great just as good as any name brand battery but at a fraction of the cost and delivered for free,5.0
i thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm i think it is too small to read on it not very comfortable as regular kindle would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead,3.0
it was a great product but i purchased it for the slingbox app last week it just stopped working on all my amazon fire sticks and fire tv they say they are working on it but it has been about a week with no resolution i am not the only one with this issue it seems to affect them all before that it worked very well better than expected not sure if they are going to get this fixed or not if they get his fixed i would rate it a  to ,3.0
tore within one week and is baby blue and very shear not green,1.0
very happy with my purchase of these we fly thru batteries at my house so this was a good investment the ones ive used so far seem to be working great and havent died yetthis would be great for christmas time toys,5.0
easy setup they are adding new commands every week it seems still has some work till it is fully functional,4.0
for the price this is a great tablet got it for my wife for christmas and she loves it,5.0
put these into a high power flashlight and took my dog out within ten minutes the flashlight was so dim that it was worthless i would never buy these again,1.0
batteries last about a week in a wall clock name brands last six months dont waste your money,1.0
if you stream everyday it is worth the investment for the k box vs the fire stick more powerful more storage more time to watch with less loading times,4.0
worth the price very light and love that its personal,4.0
they are batterieswhat more can be said how long do they last who knows just got them,4.0
my wife absolutely loves her echo and she would recommend this product to everyone,5.0
it is ok to be a android tablet with such a low price but the display is not good as they describedit hurts my eyes after long use,3.0
nice and convenient tablet for kids i like that it has parental control so parents can connell what the kids do and download on it only downfall is you cant get all apps on these,4.0
totally not convinced these are as good as name brands because i have had to replace several batteries way too soon,3.0
i bought the tablet for games and surfing the internet this is a slow tablet not made for gaming  graphics are commonly not supported super cheap tablet you get what you pay for ended up returning it,2.0
batteries very week would not work in several devices,1.0
its a great all around tablet with all the extra features you need if your an avid reader,4.0
smaller than i thought and processing speed is not very good with that said for the price you cant beat it,3.0
good product for the money compared to earlier versions not as durable the outside casing is plastic not good for the money good buy,3.0
from the beginning weve had issues with our remote,2.0
they dont last long at all not worth buying,2.0
we purchased amazon fire kids edition tablet to occupy our almost  year old for a  hour drive to florida works great and i love that there are apps that we can download from home and still access even without a wifi connection,4.0
have ordered these several times and get good use with them,5.0
perfect gift for my mother and mother in law easy to use wonderful graphicsawesome tablet,5.0
out at the farm we set up a clearstream  antenna and got about twice as many channels that we wanted to watch total about  we needed an interface for streaming and this works great in addition it gives us a remote control for our tablo to record the shows with no subscriptions needed total cord cutting,5.0
the new kindle is a good inexpensive  tablet with nice features and a good easy to use operating system it is responsive and the screen has a good resolution gb is adequate and the provided sd card slot allows you to increase your storage capacity,4.0
love it very easy to use and easy to install and run on tv,5.0
these are cheap batteries to make matters worse amazon sends old dead batteries mixed in with newer ones and ship them off to you at least half of our last and final package had dead batteries and worked for maybe a day amazon wouldnt return our money for them waste of time,1.0
i love my amazon fire tv its an amazing device its quick and very responsive overall i believe its the beat streaming device on the market,5.0
very good tablet for kids i bought a few and gifted them to kids of my relatives,4.0
good part is that they give you a lot of them bad part is they die way too quickly,3.0
why do i get so many pop up adds on this its a great product but its always trying to sell me something,3.0
i have found that a large percentage of these batteries only last about half as long as duracell i had assumed that since amazon doesnt own a battery factory that these are simply a major brand that is private labeled so i assumed they would last just as long my tv remote came with a sony battery it lasted a year i replaced it with one of these and it only lasted  months,2.0
found this tablet to be very intrusive with adds almost forced to use credit card to make things work,1.0
bought amazonbasics for all the new toys my kids were getting for christmas all of which have had to be replaced in the past couple months life of this battery isnt great,3.0
these batteries are bad in any device the last only a very short time,1.0
very satisfied with product as do my family kids,5.0
product was damaged needs lot of improvement on the apis,1.0
great for night reading no bright light to hurt eyes,5.0
for the price its tough to complain but it does occasionally stutter or get slow downs overall you cant find a tablet at this price that will outperform but if you do have the extra money i would use it for the new fire hd  instead,4.0
i love my kindle paperwhite its easy to hold and and can store hundreds of books the battery life can last weeks without charging its a must buy,5.0
this is perfect for young children and comes ready to use straight out of the box the case is very well built to protect the tablet and the device is actually pretty light and easy to hold once you sign in with your parent account you can set up your childs profile and its ready to go easy to navigate menus with great parental controls  this tablet truly delivers safe content and games for hours of enjoyment the key is to load new content while you have access to wifi so the books games and videos are available while traveling,4.0
they let for about  recharges,1.0
ive gone thru half the box everyone of these batteries lasted for about  minutes and then died not happy at all wasted money on something i needed,1.0
easy to setup great for traveling and reading on the plane,5.0
a great product for the price performs bigger than what you would expect the memory expansion elevates this tablet to allow for multiple content and apps,4.0
batteries arrived drained all of them,1.0
so at first i was happy but my computer mouse started flashing red low battery about a week of having the new battery not impressed with battery life but it works short term,2.0
the packaging is awesome very easy to store,5.0
never put a review online about a purchase  but this amazon battery leak so badly i have to discard all of them after  weeks of use dont buy this item ,1.0
so far the amazon fire is great with limited issues we are used to clicking on our dvr and watching all the taped programs we missed we are still trying to figure out how to do that on the fire,4.0
i have really enjoyed this purchase in the month that i have had it it is very versatile responds to many voice commands makes additions to my calendar  and it has a great speaker i recommend,5.0
it is ok but i like my bigger screen one but it broke in less than two years,2.0
sold it on craigslist the day i bought itwhat does that tell you,1.0
dont seem to last as long as other batteries you get what you pay for,2.0
terrible batteriesdont last longdont depend on theseyoure better off buying batteries at the dollar store then here,1.0
i love this device not sure how i have survived for so long without it this thing does it all i would recommend this product for sure the sound is great coming out of this device,5.0
amazon adds are annoying lack of compatibility with google and other apps is annoying price is great nice to have but it really isnt better than other tablets out there,3.0
whats happened to batteries duracell use to be the gold standard until we had over  of them fail by leaking and destroying expensive medical equipment year after year costco batteries became our goto batteries until last year  when they started leaking even on the shelf tried eveready but price and quality varies as well i trusted amazon and love the price packaging convenience and no leaks but they dont last half the time the others have some of the top reviews have stated the electrical case very very well and yes we have some high current draw uses but as my staff and doctors have said to me theyre just batteries get us some decent batteries already we go through dozens a week so price is going to matter but paying top dollar still doesnt seem to save equipment or increase the usage time it seems every manufacture is changing their product for cost and marketing so that you have to be an expert to properly match basic aa batteries to your specific use not cool,1.0
did not last long,2.0
worse graphics wont keep a wireless connectionoverall not satisfied,3.0
i had hoped that amazon batteries would be as good as their other services unfortunately either we got a bad batch or these batteries are not as good as other brands these were ordered in april and it is now august and i have had to use three sets of batteries in my mouse normally a set of batteries lasts three or four months i would not recommend others reviews are more positive but i personally cannot recommend this brand,1.0
i love the box lots of features can use on any tv home and vacation,5.0
i dont know why but these things dont last long maybe i dont know anything about batteries and there is certain number i should be looking for to determine the life span i ended up going through these quickly so i could probably just buy the expensive ones and get the same life rather than keeping on purchasing these,1.0
replaced a v nook but this is not better for reading,3.0
my hubby bought this for me since i was constantly googling questions on my phone i was so excited to start asking it questions the only problem is alexa doesnt have any of the answers music sounds great on it but thats about it not impressed save your money,2.0
i have an ipad that i read books on unfortunately its horrible to read on the beach park or anywhere outdoors in sunlight the kindle paperwhite is perfect for that,4.0
i needed something thats not an ipad for basic app use and it works great minimal glare even with a screen protector again its not ipad but its good for a tablet,5.0
its nice for the price nice gift for kids and grandparents,3.0
i like the closed ecosystem your kids dont see what they shouldnt what i didnt like my daughter made a purchase by mistake on day  turnoff the the one click buying also i dont like that its set up like its the parents device with the child using it so there are two steps to logging in also i dont like the lack of google apps the device itself itself has a great screen and weight the bumper is tough and easy to clean and overall i would recommend it for a yo,4.0
they could be a bit cheaper for their longevity but they are a good value overall,4.0
its an alright tablet for my parents to learn and use for skype,3.0
twc digital adapter now returned with black friday pricing this will pay for itself in months using twc app plus already a prime member have stick but needed a little more oomph for gaming on the big screen,4.0
good for the price hard to beat it,5.0
runs out fast,3.0
 ,5.0
im mostly happy but like so many electronics this one has a huge of built in advertising that you just cant get away from there is no way to identify the aps you want to see first and it always defaults the first click to an advertised movie for sell it takes many clicks to get where i want and the voice only works for purchases from amazon everywhere else you have to use the keyboard using clicks,3.0
amazon kindle needs to put more effort in their tablets not a lot of applications compatible with the amazon os but for  dlls is totally worth,3.0
i was exited about it but got disappointed same old gui  k is limited search option is only for amazon ,3.0
a good tablet for the price just need a bigger memory card,4.0
thought wed have tons of fun with alexa found that had to stretch to use it productively maybe thats why amazon puts out a steady stream of heres whats new with alexa emails a lot of them revolving around buying more stuff from amazon,2.0
great device so far still learning new features on it daily,4.0
i am really enjoying being able to read books online that are downloaded from the public library i have read  books in the last few weeks now that i can use the public library system to access book titles no more buying books at the bookstore,4.0
you cant beat the price on these batteries but unsurprisingly they dont last nearly as long as name brand ones,4.0
lost my older kindle touch so needed to purchase a new one much the same as the oldwhich is good not a hard learning curve this one however now has the light which is great very light in weight also definitely recommend,5.0
these batteries do not last very long at all,2.0
this is not appreciably faster than any other  or higher amp charger when used with my kindle kindle fire kindle fire hd various android tablets and other devices that have usb charging cablesit also blocks an adjacent outlet why didnt they put the plug on the short end like the original blackandwhite kindle chargerit is an exceptionally good deal when purchased together with a kindle fire hd on promotion but the regular price is not competitive for a supposedly premium chargeradditionally it does not come with a cable an omission that many people wont realizeedit i appreciate the many comments but amazon promotes this charger as something that charges faster than other chargers but i havent seen any such advantage at promotional prices its a good deal but not at almost twenty dollars otherwise look elsewhereedit when the review was written the description of the item did not have this statement optimized for kindle tablets powerfast is a w charger and will charge your kindle tablets faster than the white w kindle charger will that line was added a considerable amount of time after i wrote my review,3.0
unit must be charged frequently still trying to learn the fire,3.0
if adding more than one child to the account the screen will not rotate properly for the second third or fourth child geek squad could not fix this problem seems to be a manufacturers issue also there are too many adds i returned this product,1.0
yea ther good value,5.0
good for basic things or as an ereader my kids love theirs,4.0
purchased the tablet for my  month old daughter since i notice that she loves phone screens and tablets keep in mind isnt intend for kids her age but make sure there is adult supervision pluses the tablet can take a good beating tons of hard tapping and even with the tough case can even take biting as well without causing any damage to the pink case  daughter is teething lol  im a amazon prime memberwhich gives access to tons of shows and free apps so if you have prime you can totally take advantage of a full library of entertainment some of the apps are great even for my  month old daughter works great to keep her entertained also when she is older i have tons of options to change and control also i get my own side she cant do anything unless i give her actioncons average battery life hours tops of nonstop use and also wish that there was a way to lock the screen while watching amazon netflix or any other video app so when my daughter taps in any direction or anywhere that the videos wouldnt stop playing,4.0
run down very quickly,1.0
i didont care for this tablet downloading apps outside of amazon was really confusing,1.0
i love my amazon tap i was in the market for a portable speaker and i saw these one on sale so i decided to pick it up i only wanted it for a bluetooth speaker but alexa is amazing i use it everyday alexa was a huge plus,5.0
doesnot work after three weeksi cannot open it so sad,3.0
great product but the only downside is that it did not work with my home security camera,3.0
until i buy all the lights and linked products this is just a radio with limited stations,3.0
i will never purchase batteries online ever again i should have never believed that this is unique japanese technology that enables better performance after storage overdischarge and high temperatures because frankly it did not even last for two days for my digital clock that has four placements of aaa batteries at first i believed it was a bad batch of a four pack batteries no problem then a week and a half has passed and i had to change the batteries for my clock five times i hope this review will convince you the reader to never purchase these batteries i know they are not that expensive and i shouldnt make a big deal out of it but it is frustrating to see the seller lie more than once took their sweet a time to deliver it to the buyer about a month in waiting and never sent any form of confirmation in purchasing their product well thats that have a good one,1.0
its a good box if you dont mind the amazon restrictions,4.0
one star because this shouldve been included when i purchased my kindles bought this second one because i have three paper whites and got tired of playing musical charge chairs and if amazon would concentrate on the loyal ebook readers rather than the useless fires and increase memory more than the little bit they did on the latest kindle i own one i would be a happy camper we need the option of adding memory amazon invent a chip that only you sell and the only one a kindle can use and ill purchase just give us that option fires dont work for just straight up reading cant read in any kind of light because of the shiny screen having to purchase these power adapters separately ticks me off i dont care about the cloud i need books downloaded to my devices we vacation often in our mountain house middle of nowhere which i like however no wifi no internet access and no cell coverage so cloud is useless i guess i read too much thousands of books  in my library at home before a stroke forced me to kindle and now thousands more include adapters when purchasing devices and increase the storage capacity,1.0
i have a simple electronic keypad i use these batteries in with the name brand i would go about  months with the amazon brand i go  weeks not sure i am sold on this being an equivalent battery just yet,3.0
not only does what siri does but it takes it one step further by completing tasks that you ask it to do like ordering pizza or ubers which i do plenty of with extra devices hooked to lights in your home for example you can ask echo to turn your lights on dim them etc before entering the home this can be a real safety feature,5.0
love the lack of bells and whistles stuck in airport battery lasts forever,4.0
lets be realistic on two fronts about the echo  its fun to play with a novel idea  there are some serious flaws and if you doubt me you can try these yourself ask alexa these three questions what is the customer service number for ups youll be told the phone number of your nearest ups store no matter how you phrase the question alexa what is the current humidity outside youll get the days weather report no matter how you pose the question seriously it cannot even provide the humidity alexa who makes the  jet youll hear hmmm im not sure what you meant by that question so throw in a clue with alexa who makes the boeing  jet and youll hear the same answer and this product is alleged to go out to the web to pull down information from wikipedia et al the reproduction of music is egregious at best read anywhere on the internet and youll see this mentioned time and time again its very very bad imagine a s transistor radio not quite tuned well the voice quality sounds like something from a commodore back in the s another very common complaint youll read about in reviewsthis is going back tonight not worth the  and i feel its slated to go the route of the pet rock for those who remember it,1.0
this tablet is great for kids but also for adults who want something they can share with their children i love the amazon free time on it you can set time limits for your kids and it helps a lot with limiting time,4.0
i use this for videos the quality is great i use headsets the speaker is good for quiet places not to loud,5.0
i have other kindles and this one is okay for the price it was a decent buy i may go to a larger size the next time as this seems small,3.0
very satisfied with the size and performance and a great deal,4.0
i prefer spending the extra  or  to get the echo,4.0
these batteries are hyped duracell always wins i bought them for electronic circuit for my experiments and i can clearly see how they fail against duracell aaa batteries i also wonder about the review someone has put that shows the performance plots under standard conditions doesnt matter batteries need to perform the way consumers use them to be fair these batteries are better but dont show them as the best in the world no way,2.0
batteries are larger than normal and do not fit my audio gear or guitars if you need these for sound or audio id pass,1.0
all i really use it for is music the read downfall is itäôs not bluetooth so it has to be plugged in ,3.0
the tablet is certainly a good value but the wifi signal drops frequently and even when it shows its connected can fail to download any data perhaps this is a glitch that will be fixed in a later sw update but for now i have to say the performance is underwhelming the backlight also has some serious bleed issues which is a sign of an inferior design and or workmanship the fire  hd which i also own has none of these issues get what you pay for rings true again,2.0
this was just ok wish the camera quality was better,2.0
good over all i had competitors sreaming devices and none were as good as this i would recommend to buy,5.0
just received them and trying them out so far so good,3.0
i was not a fan of the amazon type operating system that is on the tablet ended up taking it back because it was not what i wanted not as easy and supportive of games and apps as an android tablet,3.0
these are awful so far ive used them in my toothbrush and have had to replace them  times in  months ive also used them in my smoke detector and had to replace them within that  month period as well seriously i usually can go a few years without replacing batteries in a smoke detector waste of money,1.0
its awesome being able to have k capability and being able to play games but it does get laggy at times,4.0
best batteries for the price,4.0
this product is a great product as long as the plugin charge port doesnt break and quit taking a charge,2.0
even though the price of the tablet matters the display and resolution should have been much better feels like working in the tablet without the charger connected amazon disappointed me with this product minor issues in installing the apps which are available in ios too,3.0
these do not work i have tried them in  different clocks and they are not working at all when replaced with other batteries the clocks started to work fine againyou get what you pay for,1.0
i mean it work fine but  fine theres nothing special here and its a joke that amazon doesnt just ship a charging plug with the kindle in the first place you should be able to find plenty of nonoem chargers thatll work in terms of watts and voltage for far less money like ,3.0
i purchased   as gifts recently believing all prior purchases would be compatible with the paperwhite i was highly disappointed to learn that interactive solitaire and word games i played on the old kindle touch were lost,3.0
pretty happy with this so far like the fact that you can add memory,4.0
very durable but could be a little more suited for young kids,4.0
bought a couple for my kids for xmass and they love them,4.0
purchase this tablet for my mother her first tablet to read books,5.0
what is there to say about batteries they provide good power and are just as good as any other brand i have purchased,5.0
i havent had them long enough,3.0
good price but didnt last to long,2.0
could not download my books at home three visits to best buy returned it,1.0
the processor is very slow the tablet is great for reading books and ordering stuff from amazon but it is really slow opening aps pay more to get the better processor,2.0
this is not like other android tablets in a bad way,1.0
love this alexa great sound technology has come a long way,5.0
purchased in sept  went to change because light was not working  batteries leaked and ruined a special optical light  now checking all other light they are in ,1.0
at first i was not sure and going to get the name brand batteries then i was like let me just give them a try its made by amazon so i must be good when i got them i was very happy because they are great batteries last very long time the big plus is the price  you get a great product for a low price,5.0
too small for me page turning constantly due to size page refresh jumpy irritating to my eyes,2.0
the amazon fire hd  model is a great tablet for the price however the fire os offers limited abilities to the user personally i wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a fire tv streaming stick also the inability to use the google play store is a major set back if it werent for those two complaint id give this tablet  stars,3.0
it is okay so to speak it does what it says it will i feel it has much more potential however and look forward to updates,3.0
works great but the app store is nothing like that of apple or google fortunately you can install many android apps from mobile the screen is fabulous and its great at its roots making reading books fun,4.0
please be aware that these batteries leak i put these in a few electric candles and alarm clocks in our house after a few days the bottom of the candles and clocks were coated with battery acid no other battery brands have done this in our house before i cannot tell you if they last long or not got rid of them immediately,1.0
i had no trouble registering this kindle fire i have a plane kindle  i like the fire a lot better it is user friendly even for first time user,4.0
surpassed my expectations it charges faster than the one that comes with kindle fire when new so i would purchase another if i ever need a new one,5.0
lol they work,4.0

alot of the batteries were dead or very weak,1.0
im not sure if its coincidence it not but two electronics weve put these batteries in have crapped out within a day of replacing the batteries when i pulled them out of the remote that completely spazzed out there was moisture on the batteries i thought that may have been my fault but then it happened again with a christmas decoration ill probably return themmaybe a faulty batch,1.0

great little tablet easy to use for kids wish the battery was bigger overall not a bad purchase,4.0

as a low priced  tablet it has a good display good speed and reasonable battery lifei am a bit peeved by the rather intrusive adds that amazon pushes onto iti am also unhappy that i cannot load all the apps i am used to using on my android phone overall i wish i had spent more for a real android device rather than having this with the amazon limited version of android,3.0

i own a high end system with appletv  and chromcast media players for netflix and the likes i purchased fire tv for k as with other devices i thought i could configure it and forget it this is not the case with fire tv remote control requires constant attention open the back play with batteries but battery cover back on constantly hdmi port does not work with hdmi switch it is the only device that i own that does not play well with my switch internet connection is poor start receiving video wont load errors after a week i thought perhaps wifi connection was bad even though no other device had this issue so i tried wired connection and got same error tried restarting it more than any device should need but this did not help device is very hot it is on constantly no automatic method of turning off when not being usedon the plus side the interface is the best i seen on any media player beautiful picture and screen saver which can be configured alexia rocks but limited to basic commands amazon prime integration is excellent as you might expect beautiful looking device after about  days i got fed up and returned it ill wait for appletv to integrate k hopefully that will be soon,2.0

this is not as cheap feeling as i thought it was going to be its definitely not in the ipad class but its not bad for what it is i ordered online and did not have one in my hands until mine arrived pros the screen is decent sound is loud enough for me no lag scrolling and real racing  plays smoothly cons the major down side is battery charging time battery life and built in storage space when it arrived it was showing  remaining after less than  hours use it had to be charged i just read where it can take  hours or longer to charge my ipad air  can fully charge in a few hours from  built in storage is not enough yes you can get micro sd cards however some apps will only install on the built in storage also you can not delete amazon apps without voiding the warranty and unless im missing something you cant move them eitherso if you are looking for something to use casually for web surfing email watching movies reading books and the occasional game this should be just finekeeping in mind the battery life and lack of built in storage but you wont be doing any serious work on this like you can on the ipads but to be fair this is  the price of my ipad air  and  the cost of an ipad mini  but i dont believe its meant to be a direct ipad competitor because if it were it would fail miserably,3.0

the unit does a good job of playing music from amazon music it hears your voice very good although it gets confused at times when i tell it to turn on a particular lamp and i have to slowly pronunciate it like that the music shows the lyrics do need a family account on amazon music to plan different music on different units in different rooms at the same time though,5.0

great price and shipped safely and amazon was efficient with the packaging i bought this pack to replace a  pack of maxell cheapo batteries that i bought on amazon years ago i finally ran out and decided to try the performance alkaline batteries from amazonbasics quality so far seems to be good they have been holding their charge well for the devices im using them on these are primarily being used for wireless keyboards and mice but the area that ive been able to gauge their performance is in a couple of battery operated led light strings that i use in my studio with the old batteries i noticed that i would get about  hours of usage before the lights would start to dim these batteries have been giving me close to double the life for the price quite impressedits hard to get too fancy on a review for aa batteries but these happen to work quite well,5.0

this is a fun device for listening to music and getting news updates i thought it would have a bit more functionality but i think i need to explore apps that it works with and i am sure more will be coming but for the price point the speaker alone is worth it,4.0

each battery only lasts a few days on my wireless mouseupdate the problem is actually with my mouse or computer other batteries are also draining too fast nevertheless it would be good if these amazon batteries stated their capacity,4.0
so far i only see one flaw that bothers me no volume control built into the remote the device is very fast easy to setup and use though it does offer prime video stud right up front but a couple pushes of a button and your on to your netflix or hulu or what have you works great with plex as well,4.0

they work greatand the price is really great,5.0
although sonos speaker sounds better this is not bad and at a cheaper price soon it is reported alexa will be able to control your sonos system as wellit also includes voice control and provides skills which allow for home automation possibilities in my mind well worth the price for the voice controlled audio features and has potential for many other uses,4.0
works well easy to use battery seems to be good would buy again,4.0

arrived and maybe only  of the batteries actually worked the ones that did not work have little juice to them or some are just deadsucks because when i ordered aa batteries from the amazon brand a while back they worked amazing and were of great price these are cheap but when you factor in how many of them you can actually use this was not a cheap buy at all,1.0

fire worked fine and was simple to set up i must add however that the overview menu should have more than a few online locations apps like netflix and youtube it should work as a main menu whose apps include things like livetv discplayer and even phonograph instead it is pretty much allamazon at least if it was easy to access it was amazon aliza was not all that helpful either for nonamazon material certainly not for tv shows that are not in the amazon library i think it is a mistake to make me change source to access almost anything but amazon i was spoiled by my previous old sony bluray disc player that did indeed act like a central menu for everything  including amazon i may be showing my age and ignorance here but i bet i have lots of company i say kiss for usage even if it means a more complicated install,3.0

alexa is a very good product it is nice in appearance and style voice quality is good and clear alexa should offer more products to folks who dont have amazon prime just to keep interest in the product it is a little pricy along with extra items you need to buy to get alexa to give more functions,4.0
i would buy it again and have twice over already i actually bought the kids fire kindle and bought this for my wife hers was lost and she borrowed my sons kid fire kindle i ended up buying her this again and would buy it again i would recommend buying a sd card it fills up fast without out it but it is a lot cheaper to buy the lower gb kindle and then buy a good sd card,4.0

lasted for barely any time at all i have no idea why some batteries last longer than others but i can attest that these were stored in the exact same condition in our home as another brand of battery and the amazon ones lasted for far less than half the life of the namebrands im always willing to give amazon products a try but these batteries left a lot to be desired,1.0
alexa works great for listening to spotifly only if you have premium and very basic information time weather she has a tough time answering questions this is not a google machine she consistently would not understand simple questions the volume is very loud and can be adjusted manually or through voice she also can learn skills which some are hit and miss id still recommend this product if you have a smart home smart outlets locks or if you have spotifly premium,3.0

some of the unused batteries stored in ac room show signs of deterioration within six months of purchase poor battery performance,1.0

bought the echo to use with my alarmcom security system as a voice recognition interface did not expect to see my friends and family also buy one for other reasons great product price too high,4.0
i dont want to get too negative on this because it does what its supposed to however im not sure how amazon justifies charging  half that and id feel a lot less disappointed its nothing like the last generation cover which was hefty and substantial that thing could take a beating this one ummnot so muchpros i really like the solution amazon came up with to lock the kindle in place sort of a rubberized cup that grips it on all four sides and holds it very securely no more metalprong sliderelease gizmo it looks quite nice and is genuine if untextured leather like the last onecons flimsy the leather is extremely thin and unpadded wont stand up to much abuse scrape it even lightly on a rough surface and youll likely ruin it the actual cover that folds over the front is incredibly floppy and delicate  its about the thickness of a piece of notepad cardboard i could bend it in half with almost no effort if i had the notion cover has no lockclosure mechanism like the elastic strap on the last gen model it should have somethingoh well it is what it is i never read with the kindle in the case anyway so its not such a big deal to me but i was expecting more especially for this price,2.0

alexa is a great tool its fun to use but the dot has just as much functionality and seems to hear my voice better the speaker on the echo is better but when the volume us up high it cant hear me at all the dot can connect to an external speaker via bluetooth or mm and its a third of the price,3.0
i thought i was getting a great deal but i learned the hard way if you don use them up quickly they go dead in a hurry extremely limited shelf life so dont buy these in bulk if you dont plan to use them w in  mos if your using them in medical equipment im sorry to say im choosing another battery i dont like bashing an amazon product and theres always the chance i got a bad batch but in this instance medical equipment you want power when you need i had several groans from the bfrnd about his tv remotes eating up his batteries i thought my wireless mice were eating them up as well so i bought another mouse but when i put  fresh packs in my tens unit  ea time they started out weak then didnt last  min ea set its time to choose another brand of battery not the product your putting it in i did test the ones i took out before putting the new ones in i didnt think to test them before putting them in,2.0

pros amazon prime works on it you can still sideload apps like kodicons not a good upgrade over the original fire tv is worse in some aspects remote buttons are hard to press compared to original fire tv remote loses connection frequently and takes several button presses or removing of the remote batteries to fix interface isnt as snappy as the original fire tv same interface as the original fire tv theres still no good way to sort your apps or locate the prime content that you want voice search seems about the same as the original fire tv alexa adds nothing significant you still cant use it to search in rd party apps like youtube as for video decoding in kodi performance isnt much better than the original fire tv you will be able to play hevc content at p with no problem but p  hip softwaredecoded does not play well theres simply not enough power k decoding is hitand miss it needs to be specifically coded for this fire tv low bitrate low fps to work properly overall system performance is bad when sitting idle the cpus spike up to  usage and memory is at  usage the os is not welloptimizedim not confident that amazon can fix these issues in a timely manner and their competitors are releasing their media players soon so ill likely return this while i still can,2.0
i like it its good for the kids to play with and easy to use,4.0
its a great product i not only have books that i read on there but also can download games for my kids,5.0
the sales rep told me this kindle fire tablet is easy to set up just follow the directions three hours later  a trip back to the store a member of the geek squad finally got my e mail to work he could not tell me why it was a problem also the camera quality is very poor if you use it to check your e mails and browse the web its fine other than that oh well,3.0

amazon products amaze me for the value of what they are this is no different a great little  inch tablet where you can surf the web watch movies read books or listen to music only really works if you have amazon prime this really unlocks the potential to really unlock the potential you can also subscribe to kindle reading unlimited if you read a lot or have several people in the family that will also read i actually opted to return this one to upgrade to the fire hd which was only about  more at the time and gives you a slightly bigger screen and hd resolution i love to stream movies,5.0
maybe i didnt give it enough time i had it a few weeks before i returned it i just didnt feel the love i see a lot of potential i was wanting to control some of my wifi connected devices like my thermostat tv and some lighting but it took a lot of programming to get it there so maybe after they do the heavy programming for outside devices then ill try it again,3.0
returned product cause i did not like it and really had no use for it,1.0
amazon echo better known as alexa is much more than a smart speaker to unlock its true music potential one should have amazon prime great at understanding basic questions alexa will also give you news briefs and play music via amazon pandora and spotify membership the true joy of alexa is its home automation commands via smartthings hue nest etc highly recommended for those seeking more than just a smart speaker with decent mono sound,5.0

it works great with my hue and also requesting music but deeper questions it doesnt know much,3.0
i was completely under the impression that this tablet was child friendly but there are no built in restrictions so my son was able to purchase numerous apps and movies my son usually uses my wifes ipad so i thought this tablet would be a good replacement but the interface is geared towards adults not a young child if you buy this tablet immediately change the settings to require a pin to make purchasesi think the age recommendation should be  not ,3.0
it works like expected the photos are not as good as my cell phone but ok enough for the price,4.0

we heard the hype and did not think we would like it or use itpurchased it on sale for  this gadget is way cool and is fun to use very useful for playing amazon prime music we like it for getting the news and weather instantaneously we integrated it with nest and wemo and it works pretty well we had hoped it would work with our sonos system but allegedly that integration is coming by the end of  the speaker isnt bad and overall we are happy with echo and its a nice to have for what we paid for it,4.0
the echo is a great product if you have money to burn and tech savvy alexa echo learns as you talk to it and ask questions you have to go online and enable different skill sets to allow alexa to answer more questions as for operating smart devices this cannot happen wirhout a huge expense you have to purchase wifismart bulbs and switches before she can operate one smart switch or wifi bulb can cist as much as  thats pretty steep to me on occasion alexa will begin talking when no one has called her to respond,3.0
i want to start out by pointing out that i honestly was not expecting much to begin with i was just hoping for something backlit to read with at night my problem with it is that it was slow to the point where it was almost unusable just bite the bullet and get a more expensive model if youre new to amazon fire this is not representative of the experience of owning one,2.0
very good experience okay at the niles ohio location great price for children  to  that arent real responsible did not buy warranty on the tablets priced a little high for something that was as priced as low as they were,3.0

i ordered these to use in my flashes to shoot a wedding they are with out a doubt the worst batteries ive ever used theyd last for maybe  to  shots and they would start to over heat i have to dump then into my shirt instead of my hand they were so hot they would burn youtypically i can run though a wedding with energizer batters  aa and only have to swap batteries once i went through this entire pack and had to go buy more at a store which the ones i bought later caused no issues and finished out the nightvery displeased and glad they did not destroy my equipment and blow up like many have had issues with i will never buy these again,1.0

i as well as other kindle lovers have noticed that although we have taken great care with the cover it has warped and has bubbles and is not durable within  months and i only started using the kindle with the cover in the past  weeks noticed the cover has become warped and bubbled under the leather no idea what would cause this i have taken great care not to put it near any source that would have done this damage not sunlight heat moisture or anything i will be requesting a replacement but kindle manufacturers of the cover need to do their homework and come up with a better product especially for the price we paid,1.0

i love it for reading but it has issues when searching the internet at times,3.0
its a decent tablet but keep the following in mind if you get this for your kids to share your amazon prime account for video and game apps you have to lock it to prevent accidental purchases problem is that this prevents free app and video purchases and you have to okay every thing they do  if you allow them access to apps and video then that can purchase anything without limitson top of this they lock out the google app store and refuse to even allow access to google drive while you can hack it to add these basic features you will need a modicum of technical knowledge to do soso its useful but a pain too your needs may vary,3.0

i was excited about the amazon echo however after getting it home setting it up and finding out how limiting it is that excitement went away fast the echo couldnt answer the majority of questions or would be asked a question and instead of answering it would play country music which i never asked forunless you have smart home features like a smart thermostat or smart lights etc it is useless aside from being a speaker which for the money it isnt a good speakeri did however try it for a week finding it not worth it or that googling questions was easier to answer even asking it about what movies were near me etc was a pain some said maybe i got a defective unit which wasnt the case the echo is just limited in what it can doi would say save your money this isnt worth it yet,1.0

i got this tablet for my  year old after her previous tablet cracked when she dropped it and wasnt too impressed with it i had to wait about  weeks for the wifi to be setup at home and found out it was way too reliant on the internet for most things to work after inserting the sd card from her other tablet i was hoping itd be easy to view videos pictures and music and had such a hard time figuring it out it took a long time for the videos and pictures to show up because i wasnt connected to wifi and it didnt recognize any music files once i did connect it it was annoying to see that ads were displayed on the lock screen overall its a good tablet but i just didnt like all the apps that are installed and rely on amazons paid services,3.0

these batteries dont last they might be a good value but for me its more important to have a battery that lasts longer or use these for hiking and rockclimbing and working on my car in the middle the night if i have a flat tire if you use them like that you want a much better battery like the name brands duracell energizer etc if you just want something thats cheap these batteries are definitely cheap but i bought the  count duracell batteries for  each i think the amazon ones go for just a bit over  each i think the duracells last more than a third longer,1.0

counting back this is my th kindle since they came out ive never had to replace one that died but sometimes i want the newer features this one is to replace the older books only unit that is starting to be uncooperative that i take to work for reading during lunch id have probably just gotten another reading only unit like a paperwhite but these were less expensivepluses can carry movies music etc like my kindle hd fire can easily let me shop on amazon can access free underground apps i really dont need it for games though and it is simple to useminus uses power quickly like the kindle fire hd i have to charge it daily to every other day i set a password very highly recommended to prevent unauthorized uses or purchases it has given me minor problems with books by marking that i was on a different page than where i stopped and it links to the other kindles and they go to that page as well for some reason accessories like cases are more expensive if you want to store a good deal more you require an sd chip  for  gb,4.0
the only issue with this kindle is the price otherwise its awesome light compact with a long battery life and tons of features like an automatic backlight which is useful if you read at night,4.0
ive had several of these fail long before they should have several instances of having to replace them much sooner that competitors batteries,2.0

much harder to work than an android none of the wallpaper apps i downloaded from the kindle store work on the device many of the other apps look cheap on the display other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper  tablet they make it look like an android tablet but it is not no google play everything is just harder to work than on a regular android but for a tablet under  it exceeds expectations it is more responsive than other models of fire,3.0
it started cutting off and on by itself its like it had a mind of its own,1.0

i had resisted a kindle for years and finally gave in for travel yes i am one of those who love books surprisingly i really like the paper white kindle it is easy to read  works well in most lighting situations there are two things that keep me from loving it  i really wish it had the option of reading the book out loud  i thought it would be a lot cheaper to get books for the kindle it may be a little cheaper but not a lot you would think that without the cost of paper etc that savings would be passed on to the customer since they dont i tuck it away until i travel,4.0

this tablet is good for the price just be aware there is adware that cannot be removed unless you pay amazon  there are other tablets available at a similar price without the adware if you are not interested in amazon products or services if you are looking for an android tablet will be disappointed this tablet has an android operating system but it is not available due to the amazon operating system overriding it the screen resolution is average if you are an amazon user this is a good tablet otherwise look elsewhere,3.0

i purchased the amazon fire tv after owning the roku  for a year and after trying both the older and the newest versions and apple tv i am a prime member so this seemed like a perfect choice however the remote is very unresponsive disconnecting more than it stays connected the menu layout is very adcentric and pushes you towards how amazon wants you to view their service when the remote works the amazon tv seems sluggish in comparison to the other products i tried after several hours of fighting with the remote i decided to return it and get another rokupossibly the version  good try amazon but far from being close to either roku or apple tv,1.0

not much to say its a bunch of aa batteries they work,5.0

i realized after purchasing that the reason you get so many for such great price is because it takes the entire box to equate to one  pack of more expensive batteries the life on these is terrible ive used them in everything from remote controls to kid toys and they run out very fast go ahead and spend the extra money for a better quality battery,1.0
im very happy with my kindle fire beyond being able to read books it does all sorts of things and is able to download a huge variety of apps it also holds a charge very long the size is perfect and portable yet the screen is much larger than a smartphone which i love i would definitely recommend this tablet to others,5.0

still adjustinghad kindle fire and liked the ease of touch for turning pages definitions and location in book paper weight is much more difficult to maneuver doesnt seem to be as touch sensitive as the fire i have to repeatedly touch screen to get page to turn and definition accessibility also takes more work also bookmarking doesnt seem to stay on page,2.0

i went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews but my experience was not a good one from the start i was on the phone every day for at least an hour with amazon tech support for one issue or another most of the techs were very polite but not all knew the product very well at one point i asked one of them about trying to save some ram and they kept referring me to the storage which told me they didnt even know the difference between ram and regular storage the internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times even when all my other wifi devices ran great then a day would pass and id be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop workingwtf come to find out its a known issue and theyre working on it after two weeks of one thing after another i got fed up and just returned it i wanted it to work and gave it a good run but just not quality stuff to me it was like walmart trying to build their own computer when theyre obviously not a computer manufacturer neither is amazon if i were you id look at a regular android tablet from a reputable pc manufacturer which is exactly what i did next i got an asus tablet for only a few dollars more and its unbelievable  better in comparison to the amazon fire hd save yourself the aggravation and go with asus or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time sorry amazon not this time,1.0

my  days old amazon fire stick quit working the system was fine it just seemed like the remote wasnt getting any juice tried  different sets of these batteries in it and it still wouldnt workand yes i put them in the right way contacted amazon about the limited warranty on remote as it was just past  days purchased and couldnt return but before sending back for warranty service and being without tv for who knows how long and just to make sure i bought some energizer batteries wouldnt you know it the remote fired right back up cant trust these batteries,1.0

this   version should have been marketed to children only its like a very dumbed down cheap version of the better firehd and hdx screen is not as good battery life is bad no mirroring to tv and its slooowww as can be if youve never owned another kind of kindle you will probably be accepting of this watered down version for those that know what a real kindle should be like you may want to pass on this one another version should be along soon and since they cant get much worse than this one youll probably get a better one i got mine on black friday for a little over  total with shopping discounts and im still sending it back thats how disappointed i am with it,1.0
i put several of these in my mouse battery and had to replace them after only a few days will not be buying more,2.0

this bag does not fit my inch laptop although mine is a little bigger than many you would need a relatively thin inch laptop to make this work also as some other reviewers described it has a cheapfeeling inner lining i also do not like that the zippers for the main pocket do not extend toward the base farther so this does not open as wide as i would like it will get the job done and serves as a replacement for my previous backpack which was falling apart but i do not think i would really recommend it to anyone,3.0
i bought this tablet for a gift for my nephew it was a bargain on black friday i have not heard any complaints from my nephew yetthe only thing i did not like was the setup it took too long,4.0

amazing tablet does everything i need it for and upgrade tricks to make it even better i like this tablet and all i can do with itwatch my shows stream music browse the internet and read my favorite books and comics,4.0
nice processor power was never a problem with the original fire tv so for streaming purposes the new chip mainly serves to support k ultra hd playback provided you have a k tv with an hdcp enabled hdmi port along with a fast internet connection amazon recommends mbps you can stream ultra hd content from either amazon video or netflix the fire tv even labels ultra hd content from amazon video on the home screen so you can quickly jump in,4.0
helps keep my son entertained on long rides and its pretty indestructible,5.0
