small tablet i have an ipad but this item is great to take along fits in your purse and is very durable i have purchased  other for family,4.0
this is a very basic functional backpack that does the job that it when designed for unlike other more expensive models this one does not have the feel or look of something that you would show off to your friends however it holds my  laptop quite well and has enough pockets to contain all of my usual travel gear the material seems to be fairly durable but it makes a crinkly sound when touched or moved this would be a good choice for a teenager who is hard on his belongings,4.0
batteries die quicker than dollar store batteries used these batteries on various products toothbrush computer mouse camera flash etc batteries at best lasted half as much compared to energizer and duracell would not recommend,1.0
the fire stick is the holy grail of entertainment easy to set up and easy to use the apps are user friendly and easy to navigate,5.0

not sure of quality his first kindle fire would no longer charge properly it was cheaper to get a new one rather than attempt to have the old one fixed he has already had a problem with this one charging properly however i believe the problem might have been with the charging cord and not the tablet itself,3.0
this tablet is a good buy for the price allows quick and easy access to the internet great product for a st time user,4.0

this was a good pick for first kids tablets i just wish getting to their apps was a little easier,4.0
this thing has major connectivity issues save your money and wait for a later version,1.0
we bought this for our  year old daughter great variety of apps books and educational videos for her to explore love the features that allow us to control her time spent on it my only complaint is that its processing speed is quite slow getting between different menus but at this price and for a year old i cant complain too much,4.0
they are batteries and they do work but not for long i pretty much base battery quality by how long they last in my wireless mouse generally i have to replace my home mouse every  months i purchased these amazon basics aa performance alkaline batteries  months ago in that time ive replaced my home mouse battery  times the rd being yet again today my daughter has also gone through  batteries in her mouse as well though she spends most of her time on her laptop with the touchpadthe shipping was fast and you get several batteries for a low cost but i think a more economical way to go is to spend a little extra on name brand dependable batteries that last  times as long,2.0
it was a great kindle fire it functions well as a reading device and a tablet plays good audio books,5.0
i like that this tablet can grow with my  year old i love the various age settings and the parental controls perfect first tablet,5.0

they dont really last long,2.0
i bought this tablet on black friday and it was on sale its incredibly slow and the screen quality is mediocre what bothered me the most were the ads on the tablet i only really use it to watch netflix so its fine but dont expect anything above that to function well on this device,2.0
its cheap so i didnt expect it to be amazing nor am i disappointed its great for streaming video even better with chromecast,2.0
got this linked to my logitech harmony hub and smartthings hub now i can just say alexa turn onoff tv and it works,5.0
product was good for  heavier than i expected i was looking to replace an older kindle nothing fancy but adequate,4.0
amazon sucks these batteries drain like the water in my toilet,1.0
worked great and no issues price made purchase affordable for family and able to use desired item that needed batteries great product and price,5.0
its a cheap tablet that you can just give to your kids or whatever the ads are annoying but then again you cant expect too much with the price point however i would not recommend using this for any kind of work at all because its very slow and finicky at times but if youre tired of giving your kids your phonetablet this is the product for you just make sure you take off your payment info maybe even make their own personal amazon account,3.0
i purchased this tablet because it was so cheap my husband loves it it comes with many free games games that youd have to pay for if you had an ipad,5.0
we bought this for our  yr old daughter and its great for most of what she does but it is not good for playing a lot of games because it locks up sometimes or it runs a little slower so if we had to do it again wed probably buy something with a bigger processor,3.0
i use a lot of batteries for lighted decorations all year round i tried these out during halloween they were the worst i tested them against sams club batteries harbor freight tools batteries and duracell the amazon always died first they even leaked that battery acid out after a few hours of use just horrible i removed these from my subscribe and save list i wont buy again,2.0
i really wanted this as a christmas present however its nothing like the ads alexa works sometimes and then not i cant get her to play music or listen to the radio through her very disappointed plan on taking it back,1.0
i purchased my eco for the holidays it took me considerable time to get minimally operational it is rather complex to hook up to other devises so far it is only hooked up to my dot i wish there were more varieties of ways to learn how to use it i am not nearly able to make use of it yet butit does look exciting if i ever get there,4.0

the worst batteries that i have ever purchased dont waste your money dont hold a charge for long and you have to buy amazons rechargeable pack doesnt work with otber brands but doesnt work with amazons either i got this huge box and about  yes  actually recharge spend the money on duracell or energizer i have a  pack of durcell with a charger and still works after years of recharging,1.0
i would say that it is not for kids is because my kids have been downloading game after game even with a  gig sd card the main operating system only allows about  gigs of games that cannot be transferred to the data card so storage is very limited,3.0
brought this as a gift for a friend and she loves it,4.0
there were  batteries missing from the pack just annoying enough to write a bad review not annoying enough to do anything else about it,1.0
these are the best most economical batteries you can get for low volume consumption items which is  of what we use these days ive used dozens of these and never had an issue with corrosion are leaking used mostly in remotes toys flashlights and general household items excellent bargain now we need to get amazon to provide recycling as well,5.0
well a good table for under  its not bad i ended getting the toshiba k tv with builtin chromecast so i need an inexpensive table so i wouldnt use my phone turns out that the tablet does have play store so i was unable to download google home this tablet would be great for kids for a started tablet you can also control how much time kids can spend on it unfortunately it wasnt for since it didnt work for what i need,3.0
i have about every single streaming player on the market this one is not better or worse than the others i got it only for using rd party apps for that it works flawlessly if you need a streaming device this one will fit the bill,4.0

my nephew loves his kindle durable structure that can withstand drops,5.0
got it last black friday was looking for a cheap decent tab couldve been better if there was a mirroring capability,4.0
very pleased with these i havent used any yet but for the price and knowing amazon put their name on these make me think they will be a great battery,5.0

wont buy again i replaced batteries in my smoke detectors with these less than two months ago replacing again with duracell the last duracell batteries lasted almost  years in the same detectors dont waste your money on these spend a little more for a good product,2.0
i previously owned the previous model there is very little difference between this and the older model apart from the k which only works with netflix at this time i still hate the ugly interface i wish amazon would allow users to use their own skins,2.0
upgrading from an older version this kindle is so much faster love my new kindle,5.0
so i love love love eink im not even a big reader but ts this magic technology that no one seems excited about there is literally ink inside the screen that moves up or down electronically so it is literally an actual printed book page that can change in an instancei like the kindle paperwhite and it does everything i need but this particular version doesnt have the same pleasing page color as my  year old kindle which is strange but i really needed the light to actually be able to read when i usually want to read so when the light is on its pretty nicethe interface is rather slow which is to be expected given its not a traditional lcd screen its literally a printing press but i wish the interface had better ways to organize and change the order of books the other problem i had was that the first one i received had a large hole in the upper layer of the screen where the light diffuses through so it had this glowing hole that reminded me of a giant stuck pixel also there were a few random stuck black spots the next one did not have these problems amazon will replace it for you if it does,3.0
it wouldnt connect to internet tried at home at a couple of wifi spots and at the store where i bought it,1.0
after much consideration we purchased alexa amazing sound and love the new features that are added regulating,5.0
i purchased  of these as christmas gifts for our niece and nephew we decided to unbox them and charge them up to be ready for christmas day after opening them discovered they will not allow you to install any free apps or use them for much unless registered with an amazon account and credit or gift card i had absolutely no interest in giving a  and  year old access to one click shopping on my account so we returned these for android type kids tablets there may be some way around this restriction but i didnt find it,1.0
these batteries are horrible we depend on aa batteries for many wireless microphone and have found that brandname batteries last about a month per our usage we switched to amazon basics to try it out when a subscription for our preferred brand was no longer available and have found that under the same usage these batteries last about a week thats a  capacity,1.0
great tabletjust needs a way to disable ads and stuff like thatif you play alot of games you should get the gb one,4.0
they seem to die pretty fast,3.0
these do not last very long at all,3.0
these are your standard aa batteries that are very similar to most other aa batteries you will find at most stores the energy output is quite similar however the price on amazon is a lot cheaper than what you can find in the store for that reason i really like using these batteries from amazon basics they are cheap and they last an acceptable amount of time for a cheap batterydimensions and closeups can be seen in the photos i have attached to the reviewincluded in this set are  batteries that are shrink wrapped in groups of prosgood amount of power outputlast an acceptable amount of timeawesome priceconsnoneadditional considerationsthese batteries are not rechargeable they are onetime use if you need a rechargeable battery you will need to look elsewhereoverall  stars  rounds up  rounds down  starsif you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and i will get back to you as soon as possible,5.0
aside from the fact that the saleman told me that the tablet would be able to get all the same apps that an android tablet would be able to get from the playstore which was hilariously wrong this product would never connect to the internet correctly i had to reset the internet every single time on the table for my son to use it starting from day one and up my son loved having the electric device and i didnt take it back for those reasons but now  days out the thing doesnt even charge anymore and im having to take it back in at least i bought the warrenty because this is literally a huge waste of money id rather have spent  on a different tablet than this garbage,1.0
i love dis tablet just wish the screen wasnt crack,2.0
if you have an amazon prime membership so that you are getting all of the videos and music then this is a great table for tossing in your bag when on the go its not the highest end but works great with the amazon features for a great price,4.0
these are decent cheap batteries but they dont last as long as eveready or duracell or rayovac they really are only good enough for remotes and the like i dont like to use them in anything else,3.0

i purchased these for the office as everyone has an apple mouse that uses aa batteries i found myself changing batteries on my mouse almost every month with these batteries yes they work but not for long we purchased these in september and we blew through these in  months with  employees with duracell batteries which i purchased again they last much longer several months instead of just one month,3.0
while there are many budget tablets out there not all of them are functional this one is if you are part of the amazon universe this links seamlessly book purchases sync without effort movies are easy to see on amazon prime and you can use netflix also alexa is an added bonus not sure the camera will get much use but it is there if you want it amazon is slowly opening up their market place to other popular apps so expect more note i turned off the wifi and just used this as an ereader and didnt have to charge it for almost  weeks,5.0
serves its purpose,3.0
batteries leaked when in charging station,1.0
cheap durable and lasting the only time im going to buy batteries here from now on amazon,5.0
they last less than your average alkaline batteries,3.0
totally satisfied also own apple tv which i ended up moving to bedroom and putting fire stick on main tv fire stick seems to be more open to multiple programmings compared to app store only programs with apple tv but in defense for apple tv its syncing abilities with my iphone and macbook are well received price wise firestick has the advantage,5.0
a waste of money you dont need this just plug your tablet into your computer and the charge lasts for a month,1.0
horrible do not buyi bought these in aa and aaa and they all lasted just a few days my battery tester shows them on the lower side of good when unused but doesnt take long before they stop working,1.0

bought these for my sisters day care she said half of them did not work at all were dead when received,1.0
never knows answers to question or has the song i want and always says not getting connection it sucks,1.0
so i saw all the glowing reviews and was startled by the low price for  of this alkaline batteries yeah well now i am startled by how long they last uhoh make that dont last i dont take but  to  shots from my little finepix camera before the lens starts closing when i try to shoot compare that towell im not gonna lie i never counted but i took tons of shots using duracell alkaline bats conservative estimate at least  shots for each set of two einstein not needed to do the math on that i just looked and see that they are made in indonesia which may or may not matter since i dont know where duracells are made i still have  of these lousy things left ticks me off royallynow let us see if this shows as a confirmed purchase,1.0
runs great very efficient for what we use it for,4.0
i am in love with the tablet it is a perfect tablet for me to use at home and on the road for basic internet tasks i am able to download apps and also use it as a reader i love it,5.0

after less than mos i started seeing a lot of leakage,2.0
many uses weather intercom purchasing games and it continues to add functions,5.0
these are just aa batteries and i really cant get excited about them but heres the reason im giving them  stars i had typically been buying kirkland brand aa batteries at costco the kirkland batteries come loose in this large cardboard packaging with a plastic tray thing to hold the batteries the packaging of these batteries wrapped in  packs in a little cardboard container is so much nicer for storage than the kirkland batteries the packaging alone compared to what ive been dealing with makes this a  star product in my mind,5.0
we bought this tablet right before a trip outoftown and it was a good purchase eightyearolds crave entertainment and the amazon fire gives plenty of thatits been easy to handle and hasnt had any issues breaking downthe charger cable is a pain to plug into the tablet only the part that fits into the tablet itself and some of the tablet versions of apps like neko atsume arent good compared to the phone versions but we are overall very happy with our purchase,4.0
got this for my dad for christmas he likes that the speakers sound better he also enjoys being able to make video calls with it,5.0
love that prime membership allows me to see all other moviesbye bye netflix,5.0
i bought this tablet as a gift for my motherinlaw who is not very techsavvy she already owns a laptop but was interested in getting a tablet to use while watching tv rather than a whole laptop she also travels around quite a bit so having something light she could take with her was a big plus ive owned a couple amazon tablets before so i had an idea of how they worked and i wanted something at a low price point so i decided on this so far she loves it a couple of important pointsthe low price point comes at the cost of hardware after using my fire hdx this tablet felt just a little slow but not excessively so it performed better in basic tasks loading apps web browsing etc than i expected based on my experiences with other tablets at similar price pointsas an amazon tablet this runs a modified version of android but does not have bakedin access to google services including the google play store you will be restricted to amazonapproved apps unless you sideload apps on your own or are able to get access to google services yourself popular apps like netflix skype and facebook are all present but the selection pales in comparison to native android,5.0
my granddaughter love it works good she is on it all day,5.0
screen resolution could be better i got what i paid for fine for browsing,3.0
i used these in wireless microphones in church they didnt last as long as i expected actually rechargeable batteries do nearly as well,3.0
love everything about the unit except that it gets hot when used for  to  minutes hope it doesnt burn or explode,2.0
these batteries are good last long but are temperamental my electric trash can opens on a motion sensor it worked great with the batteries for about a month but then the trash can couldnt draw enough power in order to raise the lid then another week rolls by and the trash can works fine i dont know if its the batteries or the trash can but im assuming its the batteries other than that they work fine in everything else,4.0
the echo is a great product it was easy to set up and alexa was answering questions in no time there are several basic functions that the echo is wonderful at news weather music time and timing i love playing the jeopardy game i think that if i have anything to say on the down side it is that i had a higher expectation of the products ability to search the internet for answers to some of my questions lots of my inquiries come back with the answer i did not understand that question or im sorry i do not know the answer these are only a minor irritationamusement overall i am pleased with the product hopefully i will grow in my knowledge of the product and echo will also grow in abilities through upgrades,4.0
so far im enjoying it but i do miss my wireless headset receiver on the roku  remote remotei switched because im able to put kodi on the fire tv you cannot on roku ,5.0
i buy this tablet for my nephew and he is happy with it,5.0
bought this for my mom that is electronically challenged and she loves it makes her feel like she is a tech wiz makes me feel better about her ability to turn lights on and off as she comes and goes more importantly she is in her s and iives alone she can make a phone call using alexa from anywhere she has an echo i bought her  to cover her whole house this means if she falls down and canäôt get to her phone she can dial me or  with her voicea must have,5.0
do not buy all batteries arrived completely dead i thought it might be a bad batch ordered more all arrived dead,1.0
i bought this product to gift to a year old kid and she loved it she plays games puzzles,3.0

i purchased the fire tablet with expectations of a average performing tablet at best i was surprised to see that the tablet performed way better than expected and is still doing so i would recommend this tablet to anyone that wants a good performing tablet without a hd screen,4.0
it wouldnt connect with any of my smart home items it wouldnt understand some commands,1.0
not good hate it  never buy it again sucks done,1.0
i bought this to replace my old kindle paperwhite which i wore out that poor old thing had been through the wars and kept on going i can not complain about a device that lasted for several years it was used daily shoved into a purse without a case or cover and had been sat on by people and cats the only thing i wish would be that the charging cable supplied had the wall plug to go with the usb cable,5.0
the echo is a fun gadget it would be nice if you could give it any name you want but other than that it is a lot of fun,5.0
he loves electronics around christmas so this was right up his alley he loves telling alexa to do things like turn up the thermostat or to play songs,4.0
i ended up returning it after  days the browser was too slow i bought so i wouldnt have to look stuff up on my phone all the time ended up being slow so i just ended up always using my phone,3.0
hands down you cant go wrong with this tablet especially if its on sale and lower than the normal  retail price sure some google apps might not be in the market place but a majority are and if your looking for just another tablet for mobile games or another screen for netflix or hulu this tablet would do just fine,4.0
we  amazon fires for our kids for christmas we chose these because product reviews were good and the price was decent compared to other electronic pads since having them they have been decent but not great the kids will turn them on to play games and their home screens dont always appear sometimes when they want to play a game that is already downloaded the pad acts like it needs to redownload the game and there is a lot of frustration when all of the downloads start circling and they cannot do anything with their pads turning the pads completely off does not always help and sometimes we cannot even get them to turn off when they do work properly though the kids love them they are decent for a st time pad for kids for not a lot of money but just keep in mind they can be frustrating at times,3.0
the looks and the screen of amazon  fire hd  kids edition are good the navigation is sluggish when compared to apple and samsung the touch screen is not very responsive camera is not so good amazon should have done much better job to make it a better product to compete with samsung and apple hope amazon makes improvements the cost is low and appreciate that i would not recommend to someone who is looking for good product i cost is the factor you can live with it,2.0
i got this stuff for myself to watch netflix youtube,2.0
so far they have worked well i do not know how to compare them on quality yet,3.0
it works great if you have a chance to get one i would recommend it,5.0
the resolution and contrast of the screen are excellent but the real selling points are how easy it is to read in natural light including bright sunlight and the battery life i have only charged it once since i got it about  weeks ago,4.0
nice size very clear but randomly shuts off cant remove unwanted apps from the home screen if you watch videoit buffers alot and laggs,2.0
even though you need to have a amazon prime membership to fully exploit the tab  it comes at a very very cheap price,4.0
not the greatest for productivity but its very good at entertaining kids at a cheap price,3.0
alexa features work great sound is very good for a small portable speaker the whole family enjoys interacting with alexa mostly used for playing music wireless was easy to connect recommended,5.0
i dont own this first off but  amp wont charge anything very quickly and i only write this review because they advertised it on my fire the price is  as of this advert and thats way out of line for a  amp charger,2.0
i bought this as a birthday gift a few weeks before the party when it was removed from package and turned on the image was cracked like the screen was broken but screen was not broken best buy washed their hands of it and said to call amazon i did and had to go through over a weeks worth of calling them to get it replaced best buy lost me as a customer over this if you buy this from them make them open it before you pay to verify it works,1.0
i was hoping to use google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen still cheap and fine for watching movies,3.0
do not use these in any techy gadget including remote controls keyboards and especially cameras,1.0
we were so excited to get the tap since it was a larger speaker than the dot and unlike the echo has a battery charger with it to make it portable we already have an echo which works perfectly in our home when listening to online radio on the tap it cut in and out constantly we returned it and exchanged gor the dot,1.0
only  batteries in the package when advertised as ,3.0
we switched from roku  to amazon fire it has take some getting use too but we like it several friends recommended it and i would recommend it,4.0
i absolutely love this tablet i love the price compared to other tablets on the market plus the display looks great at first i was a bit skeptical about how it ran or if it was any good but i actually read a personal review about the amazon fire and it seemed like the person had a great time using it the article was very helpful to me  if you want to check it out yourself you can read it here httpwwwquikrevcomfiretabletdisplaywifigbincludesspecialoffersblack,4.0
this tablet is sufficient for secondary use at times searches are slow and memory is limited,3.0
didnt know you had to buy space and many other things for this item to work,1.0
were finding it hard to navigate this thing others mostly the young ones think its easy,3.0
great price but they dont hold their charge for long i find myself swapping out the remote batteries twice a year at this price its not so bad but its much more frequently that im used to,1.0
the amazon fire is a great tablet u cannot beat the price works as good as other way more expensive tablets,5.0
good but dont seem to last as long as major brands,3.0
i got the tablet for my two year old son and he loves his tablet,5.0
these were ordered one for  year old and then ordered second one for  year old they are easy to use and age appropriate apps for each of them,4.0
found they didnt last as long as regular alkaline batterieswould not buy again,2.0
my family and i enjoy spending time together watching movies for relaxation and entertainment the amazon product has been easy to use,5.0
i put these batteries in  of the  window candles that i bought  i put my last  duracell in the other  the amazon batteries lasted for about  days and the duracell lasted for  since then ive experimented to see if this is consistent  it is the duracell last an average of  longer,3.0
this tablet is so great for the price but amazon has always put out excellent product this is fairly lightweight and pretty fast too like all amazon product it ties all your amazon accounts so downloads and purchases are super easy i have dropped it a couple of times and no damage so its pretty tough too,5.0
love the product not happy that there have been two sales on it at best buy one  days after purchase  off today  days after purchase online  off they wont help me after  days i was told,3.0
i would opt for an ipad rather than the kindle just because of the ease of researching books by authors etc the only advantage of the kindle is the attractive comparative price,3.0
we purchased this tablet for our  y ear old since all the other kidfriendly tablets were limited it what they had on them something should be changed regarding the port for the charger the little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point  months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended i am over tablets if you can buy it on black friday for  bucks or less it should be that price all year long so now he has no tablet because i am not sending it out to have someone elses sent back to merefurbished i am very disappointed,1.0
good ereader not great for surfing web good for children and reading,3.0
perfect products with perfect recommendations i enjoy with kindle thank you,5.0
i have had a few kindles in the past so this was nothing new for me but what i loved about this one is that the screen is big so when i am reading a book its a lot easier than when i had the first kindle screen i mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when i want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing i love it,5.0
my internet is so awful that streaming music is so choppy and sporadic it reminds me of vinyl records likeabroken record,4.0
seems to fix the faulty cable on my sons headset well,5.0
this is useless i have tried to calibrate it to my smart home pointless,1.0
i like it its money well spent i will recommend it ,4.0
really good price for a reason first two batteries i used were dead do not waste your money,1.0
good tablet for reading books you love still need to get used to it since all i have used in the past are apple products ,3.0
this device works as it is advertised to work im very happy with this product it is speedy fast processing and has great graphics,5.0
i now have  kindles but chose my new fire so i can have my email etc at my fingertips,5.0
i bought this to replace my kindle touch since kindles no longer have speaker options its good for reading but to small to be used as a primary tool,4.0
easy set up but did not meet my needs of being able to access spectrum app ,2.0
half the batteries didnt work,2.0
this is perfect i carry mine  super fast also only downside is the battery life is not good i have to charge at least once a week no matter how i use the settingslight level,4.0
these are budget friendly but dont last i bought for my battery operated candles that typically use batteries for  weeks twice these batteries barely lasted  week it was so disappointing amazon produce are usually so good but i would not recommend these,1.0
if you use okay google on your phone as much as i do youll love alexa no more having to pull your phone out just ask alexa she is a great house assistant,5.0
this tablet is really good very much user friendly,4.0
very small in size not exactly what i had thought but yet good product for the price i paid,3.0
it would have been nice if the charging cord was more compatible with other devices,4.0
i especially like its versatility and ease of use,4.0
horrible quality these last  to  days in an xbox controller and maybe  days in a remote horrible quality,1.0
i was so excited to start streaming k with this and the disappointment was terrible it just never seemed to hit k while my smart tv has no problem with it the only reason i bought it was because i loved the original fire tv and loved the setup also it was glitchy and laggy i gave it  days and returned it,1.0
maybe i got a bad batch however with  batteries youd think if that were the case that some of them would work well and for me they have not the main way these are being used are in an xbox remote the xbox is only used to run netflix hulu and amazon video on our tv so i am basically using the game remote as a tv remote it is never used for playing video games that being said i am lucky if a set of  of these batteries lasts  days in this remote that is a far cry from name brand batteries i have bought i purchased these thinking they would be a great deal however going through them x as fast as other batteries makes them a worse value not to mention it is annoying to have to change them out so often i will use up the ones i already bought then i will not be buying any more,2.0
use these in a wireless bt mouse has about  less life as copper top brand good price but most likely will not buy again,2.0
i purchased this tablet for a need family for christmasi know they really enjoyed it,4.0
im a huge fan of amazon so i figured id give these a shot these have no life whatsoever even something as lowpower as tv remotes they only last about  weeks topsspend the extra money and go with name brand,1.0
these batteries are not lasting at all very short life on them super disappointed,1.0
good product but very hard to customize like real androids can not install firefox or other sw that amazon deems a competitiontoo bad,3.0
i actually ended up returning this item because i got frustrated with the adds if it wasnt for that i probably would have given it  stars,3.0
good sound quality charging dock is an added advantage,4.0
sound quality is pretty good if you want it to play background music but i still prefer sonos for this purpose alexa is useful for controlling the widest range of smart home products but its not backed by google homes superior search intelligence so it isnt that great for asking indepth questions of it there are comparisons of these products out there so take a look before making a decision since i mostly wanted it for home control it suits my need,3.0
very functional for a tablet and ereader this was a purchase for my stepmom who broke her previous kindle she likes it because the screen is big ease of use and you can access the internet the kids side is good too for the kids but some of the apps like youtube and youtube kids will not play on this because its an amazon operating system overall i would recommend this to people who like the regular ereaders and want a tablet,4.0
tons of movies and all the sports you want no more cable,5.0
i like the kindle it is light and easy too sue battery life is good,3.0
problem is battery life seems short compared to earlier models,4.0
great product fun and interesting would recommend to everyone,5.0
sadly these batteries are horrible i hardly ever have complaints about anything i order but these batteries barely have any power and ive had to change them out many times,1.0
love my amazon firetv stick bought one for my whole family,5.0
i like everything about the voyage reader it has a crisp display is small and lightweight i give it four stars instead of five because the screen light takes sometimes a while to adjust the battery life is amazing prize could be a little less,4.0
amazonbasics never disappoints these are good quality batteries at a much better price compared to duracell which i think these are comparable too a great deal for this huge pack,5.0
approximately half of the batteries ive tried so far are dead low expectations for the remainder of the lot and never buy these again,1.0
ive been using a kindle forever and when it became apparent i needed an android device i have a windows phone which i love but has serious app limitations i thought i with a fire i could get a tablet and upgrade my kindle at the same time but even with geek squad help i could never figure out how to upload the apps i needed onto the fire so back it went replaced with a lenovo tablet that does the trick,2.0
i was giving the tablet as a gift for christmas to a  year old i initially purchased the standard version but returned it for the kid version which included a bumper box as well as a  year warranty which the standard version did not have thankfully i asked the parent of the child if it was ok for me to set it up prior to giving it to the child the set up took some time i was thankful that i read the reviews because i bought an additional memory card since the product only has gb of storage the child was able to open the gift and play immediately as a result of doing upfront work one thing i noted that when the child played a movie through netflix the resolution was not very good could be an adjustment needed in the tablet which has yet to be worked out i would recommend this but if giving as a gift for a child i would recommend doing the upfront work so it is ready to go for the child when they receive it,4.0
wonderful product user friendly and if help is needed online support is available,5.0
i bought this for my  year old so she would have another option for watching her shows besides my ipad needless to say she was too frustrated with the slowness to load the netflix app and it would only get internet if you were in the same room as the modem you really do get what you pay for if you buy this dont count on getting online very seamlessly the internet browser is really slow to use but you can get around this by downloading google play store to access the firefox app which is not offered on the amazon app store check youtube for instructions,1.0
ive had my echo now for a month it was easy to set up it interprets both my commands and my wifes commands very well and we continue to find helpful ways to use it daytoday,5.0
not the longest lasting but good for the price,3.0
i bought this to replace a year old kindle fire  hdx that i had just dropped on the floor i sort of panicked so after doing a couple of hours of research i picked this tablet just to be on the safe side i got  additional gb of memory i installed a couple of games none of them memory hogs and a cookbook app in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries i can honestly say this is the slowest tablet ive ever had just rotating the screen takes  seconds and thats if theres only one app open opening a book or magazine can take half a minute and god help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while youre cooking amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers since there are no other fire tablets available for whatever reason maybe theyre being discontinued ill be replacing it with either an ipad or a galaxy tablet,1.0
my son truly loves his kindle he uses it everyday,3.0
i have had a regular black and white kindle for years and i love it but i wanted something back lighted to take on vacation and night reading the fire is perfect small and light and easy to use,5.0
dont seem to last very long,2.0
i bought the echo show because a friend of mine was excited about his im hoping it makes a great christmas present for our family,5.0
easy to order easy to keep a reoccurring order if you tend use batteries often i dont notice a difference between this brand or a more popular branch in terms of durability we keep them on hand at our house because you never know when youll need one or four of them ill be ordering them again soon,5.0
right size to carry anywhere very good display to read great camera great to take on long trips with books and movies,4.0
this ereader meets all expectations and has a good feel to it,5.0
the music is great phil cannot read or write but loves music,4.0
have this set up in the living room make sure to mute it when youre watching youtube videos or stuff will start happeningand youll run out screamingwhich ive found can be very embarrassing,4.0
i bought these but will not reorder they work but seem to go flat rather quickly,3.0
took around  and a half days for the you tube to start the video but its decent enough once it started you can never be sure when it is gonna work and when not,2.0
bought for my  children ages and  they all seem to love them my only problem is the battery life is low so they are always complaining that they are shutting offfor a parent that is not to big a problem unless you work from home and are trying to keep them quite,4.0
was tired of getting ripped off by greenlight cable so decided to do something about itno monthly charge or late fees for movies,3.0
ok for the price used for games and checking emails havent explored other uses at this time,3.0
the teacher really likes this new tablet in their classroom,4.0
everyone read the  star reviewsthe  star reviews must be people reviewing immediately the  year promise is crap i have  aa and  aaa batteries that are all dead after  year the dollar tree batteries are better pay the extra money and dont fall for amazons broken promises or guarantees,1.0
my gesr fit heart monitor was not compatible with android level,2.0
works very well for my new kindle,5.0
they last a while and are cheap what more could you want,5.0
i took it back the day after purchasing it the screen looks like you are scrolling through old news print blacks out each moment you move it i thought it was a defect but nope according to the geek squad thats just the way it is now ,1.0
no the best tabler is loaded with bloatware from amazon,2.0
everyone knows kindle fire when these went on sale i grabbed a few up to use as kiosks for our pta little did i know that fires run a special operating system not a standard android the  apps i needed to run were not available on kindle store after much research i found a work around but it was very frustrating,3.0
these are not comparable to duracell i have been running around changing batteries everywhere remotes clocks batterypowered soap dispensers all the dying batteries are the lame amazon basics bought duracells at costco they probably last twice as long i bought these to get free shipping on orders over  dont do the same its not worth it very disappointing,2.0
bought a  pack to give them a try and found they dont hold up well in the tv remotes gone back to duracells,1.0
it is a lot more then i was after i can watch my netfix and do more,3.0
a decent machine for the black friday price of under  the  gb of memory is inadequate if you play games using the apps i added a  gb micro sd card but not all the apps use it and the ones that do only transfer part of the application to it all points coins etc earned are retained in internal memory not sd card pictures videos music can be stored on sd card screen is very sharp,3.0
it is tough to use these tablets if you are use to apple products internal memory is minimal and is taken up by all of the amazon programs it is running everytime my kids play a game the wireless connection shuts down due to running out of memory i would not recommend these tablets for anything more that an ebook reader,2.0
i have an old kindle touch the last one that still had texttovoice which no longer works i decided to upgrade started reading the reviews was enticed by the the kindle voyage and took the plunge the voyage is pretty and sleek with neat features and i enjoyed using it for a few days but my frugal self just couldnt justify the price difference between it and the paperwhite while the ambient light sensor was nice i often ended up just adjusting it manually because it was still a little bright in a completely dark room i made more errors of turning a page than i meant to with the page turn because of where the page turn spots are located plus im in the habit of flipping pages on the phone or a tablet so i kept swiping despite the availability of page turn however the clarity of the screen the quality of the light the form factor the weight and the way it felt in my hand while reading were all very nice nonetheless the price difference bothered me enough to return it and get the paperwhite the thing i miss most about the voyage is the quality of the light and how even the lighting is on it the unit i had did not have blank spots or a yellowish top half of the page or any of the lighting issues some reviewers mentioned with the voyage i purchased the newest model of the paperwhite and i like it but the lighting appears pretty dingy however its only when theyre compared sidetoside that i wished i wasnt so cost conscious if money is not an object id say get the kindle voyage if it is the paperwhite is a fine little reader and overall im happy i have it,4.0
the amazon kindle fire is great for amazon shopping it offers games music movies and more that only the kindle fire with amazon can offer it truely meets a  star rating from me the kindle fire has a very competitive price when considering other devices,4.0
do not last as long as other cut price batteries in my canon digital camera i cannot get off more than  shots before the lowbattery warning comes on i am going back to maxell which did much better for mei would hate to see what the capacity of the amazonbasics everyday batteries are,2.0
this refrigerator is absolutely terrific the features are very well thought out it works well for a mom who is into healthy eating with plenty of space and for kids with their own drawer for snacks and beverages its attractive too,5.0
these batteries die quickly,2.0
i tried these thinking they were much less expensive than the brand name batteries and they would likely last a similar amount of time i was wrong i primarily use these in remote controls while i dont have specific test results the duracell batteries would last well over a year in my dish remote i purchased these in february and have already replaced the batteries twice perhaps i ended up with a bad batch but i wont be trying these again,2.0
my brotherinlaw and his family have enjoyed it very much he says finding songs is better and faster than pandora,4.0
basic performance didnt last a week in an am radio,1.0
i personally has kindle vovage paperwhite has flash on every page turn which is bit not good reading experience,4.0
little putsy so far but there are continuous updates that i think will make this a great device to stay connected with family bought a second for my dad who knows he might replace his land line someday if this gets better i do think our original echo is a bit better at responding but i enjoy this one in the kitchen aka hub of the house,4.0
very disappointed with these batteries i was using them in a wall clock the clock repeatedly did not work after a new battery was put in i figured the clock was no good since the batteries were new bought a new clock same thing happened decided to test the batteries prior to installation i found that of the twenty batteries i tested only  tested good so therefore my first clock probably wasnt bad in the first place the batteries are faulty i still have  batteries left to test but i not hopeful that these will be any better,2.0
i like amazonbasics products so i was excited to see these batteries to find out if they were a good value i looked up data online bottom line for flashlights toys and steady drain devices youll be better off buying rayovac alkalines here on amazon for cameras and photo flashes duracell coppertops will be betterheres why rayovacs cost a little bit more per battery but they hold more energy than these amazonbasics batteries as a result the final price per amount of power is about the same you just wont have to change batteries as oftenthose rayovacs work best in steady drain devices but not so well in cameras or flashes for those high drain devices duracell coppertops hold up better and end up being cheaperbattery ninja tested these amazonbasics aas in toothbrushes i did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power mwh but that they do not carry as much energy as others the test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others at least in the toothbrushes there were no test results vs digital cameras photo flashes or toys so im extrapolating that these will perform like rayovacs not like duracell coppertopsso the only data to compare here is the toothbrush test for energy delivered these amazonbasics batteries cost about the same as rayovac batteries but will die sooner to say that another way these batteries cost less but also deliver less powerboth rayovac and amazon basics are better than energizer batteries which appear to consistently give less power and still cost more i guess the money goes to the energizer bunnyduracell coppertops will last longer in flashlights toys and toothbrushes but cost a little bit more per unit of power mwh on the other hand they hold up better in cameras and similar electronics theyre probably the best all around battery so if you dont like changing batteries and a willing to spend a tiny bit more coppertops are a good way to gofinally the best value battery is interesting it is the costco kirkland signature battery ninjas results show that and so do the tests from consumer reports you can buy those costco batteries here on amazon but the price is higher than youd get at the club of course im not a costco member so it doesnt matter to me but buying them here on amazon is not a good value,3.0
decent product not so much if youre used to android software you cant get your photos saved in google more than half of my music collection vanished once the memory card was inserted basicly have to hack the thing to get any apps outside of amazon and then reliability is poor exchanged it for am android tablet,2.0
i love the echo show and its many features great purchase,5.0
batteries last a fraction of the time that most of the other well known battery brands do,2.0
i researched different readers before deciding on the kindle i figured i may as well get something that will benefit from my amazon prime membership i am soooo happy i did i have done more reading since my purchase than i have done in over a year highly recommend,5.0
i really like how she is able to interact and plays music with great sound she interacts with my smart home,5.0
they do not last like other batteries i use in candles with timers i get maybe  weeks out of them  hours i use to get months out of my duracell,2.0
i purchased this tablet for my daughter and ordered a protective case for it she really enjoys amazon free time and i really like the way amazon software works,4.0
my kids love itbeats buying a galaxy tab thats double the price and compariable in my opinion,4.0
im ambivalent about this tablet its a great price point and the picture quality is amazing its great for watching netflix but you are locked in to only the apps available on amazon i cant download my browser if choice or even the google search app additionally the tablet is linked to amazon and basically unusable if you dont have a valid amazon account i bought an additional tablet for a non amazon person and they couldnt download any apps,3.0
these batteries work they dont last as long as id like but they do work fine they came in frustration free packaging that i ended up needing scissors to open because they batteries come shrink wrapped in a little box and getting the plastic off of the batteries was not frustration free so three stars because they work but arent great i will probably not reorder these,3.0
holds basically a  minute steady usage charge and dies we used these in microphones and they died within the  minute range fully chargedit also seems that the older they get the longer it takes to charge and the faster they die out not very reliable unfortunately,2.0
i thought this would be a good idea to buy my children after i spoke with an associate at best buy and explained that i wanted this my my small children so they could play on youtube he told me that it would work food for that well that was not the case i cannot ever get on you tube and my kids have not even used it after they initially tried,1.0
tablet good for kids and some adults price and screen resolution were also a selling point,4.0
not what i was thinking most questions asked i get response hmm,3.0
does everything i need thank you alight small package easy to take anywhere,3.0
i read a lot of reviews and convinced myself the amazonbasics aa alkaline batteries were going to be a good buy nope i put a pair in my tv remote and within a month the tv was telling me to replace the batteries because of low power i decided to check some new ones right out of the wrapper with my battery tester  brand new batteries tested  all  in the red on the battery testernot totally dead but just inside the red next trip to home depot i picked up the big pack of energizer aa batteries and did the same test on them  for  all in the green on my battery testeroh well not worth crying about  worth of weak batteries i am sure others have had great luck with the same amazonbasics aa batteries i just wanted to add my experience so others can make an informed decision good luck,1.0
i would give it zero stars if possible every single battery came dead every single one completely useless and a waste of time to try and fight for a refund usually i have great faith in amazonbasics but now im not so sure,1.0
after only  days the device would not charge it was plugged in each evening and on the th day it was at  after being plugged in all night this was our second amazon fire tablet the first one stopped charging in month  right after the manufacturers warranty expired decided to get another one because it was a great deal but sadly ive learned you dont even get what you pay for with this tablet,1.0
i have  of the gen  fire tv boxes and they are good showing their age i purchased the new firetv only be to disappointedpros sd card slotcons many apps just dont work or are buggysearch is terrible and only gives amazon options  nvidia shield also gives my plex server option  now that is cool not much faster if at all than gen ,1.0
they dont seem to work except in very low energy items cant get them to work in my remotes or in a motion sensor light but it works on a smaller switch activated night light  oh well,1.0
bought this item with high expectations of its capabilities it would be extremely lenghty to supply full details let me just say that technology is not there yet with ai devices like this,2.0
good capabilities good sound quick responses good amount of applications which respond quickly,4.0
this has been pretty easy for my kids to use and navigate they really like it,3.0
these die way too fast,1.0
very short lifespan,2.0
so slow camera not good very low quality of picture get apple ipad mini instead,1.0
good beginner tablet for kids could use a better resolution screen but overall it is good,4.0
bought this for my son he really enjoys using it especially as an ereader,4.0
brand names are better these were not very long lasting you get what you pay for,3.0
sadly no having netflix support is resulting in my last tablet purchase from amazon,2.0
worst batteries ive ever bought,1.0
purchased this device at launch  pack for xx and now youtube doesnt work youtube was one of the main features that i used without youtube youll be better off buying the  echo dot instead,1.0
i like how they are organized in the box into packs of  the box further separates them into groups and great to keep for storing them in batteries seem to work just fine plus they is cheap,5.0
i purchased this ereader because it stated you could get library booksvia usb cord and wifi if you are near one i do not have wifi andthe usb would not transfer tried everything neighbor tried readinstructions viewed youtube but it wouldnt work took it back but it was beyond  days and they would only give me credit i then upgraded to wifi g and that better work for the extra money very disappointed as i felt i had no other choice,1.0
lady had been looking for one of these since xmas and found one and loves it,5.0
these batteries are the worst batteries ive ever purchased i am in disbelief how quickly they died i put them in  very small  tall portable night lights for my kids and both night lights became very dim overnight the batteries had to be replaced after  nights for the night lights to even serve the purpose ive since put these batteries in other things around the house and i am not impressed at all ill stick to buying batteries at costco in the future,1.0
i purchased the fire tv box and it just stopped working one day wont boot just sits at the logo i spoke to customer service who could care less they said the best they could do is sell me another box seeing that my warranty had expired its not like i bought this in  someone there even told me that if i have a roku box i can watch it with that instead totally unexceptionable me an my wife are long time prime members and expected a little more from amazon i am on my way to buy an nvidia shield tv for my streaming needs btw it doesnt have an amazon app wink this is the first box i have ever owned that just stopped working,1.0
run out super quick would not buy again,1.0
great tablet for the price i bought two of these for my grandkids to use as they are always using ours the only thing that i really dont like about them is that they have so many pop in commercials for grown ups and it makes everything stop hard for my little three year old to get this i wish it were a little more kid friendly as far as ease of use and getting to where you want to be for the price i guess we will just deal with it ,3.0
i bought this product for my grandmother since she has a hard time reading the small print in books the kindle paperwhite has a large font setting that has made reading much easier for her and the matte screen provides for minimized glare she can now easily read a book again,4.0
their regular batteries what else can i say about em,3.0
i enjoy my kindle fire very much great price buy,4.0
these were gifts for young family members and they are really enjoying them but the initial setup was a pain,3.0
good deal,5.0
these batteries did not do the job for us they were low powered and did not last as long as their competitioni thought all aa batteries were the same but after our experience with these i have to say that you get what you pay fori am not sure how or why they are different than other batteries lower voltage less capacitancethey are cheap  do not buy them,1.0
i have to say this was not that great a purchase and we will most likely be taking advantage of its greatest product feature which is the ability to return it for a full refund we wanted a smaller tablet for our kids well this is smaller in every way options are limited and we have realized that we are better off just letting the kids use our tablet so we can buy the newest one this thing may go back to the store as soon as tonight,2.0
daughter got this as a present it was easy to set up and display is great features allow us to limit her time on games web etc while allowing her unlimited time to read,5.0

this is a good tablet for the price however it runs slow and the touch screen response is not the best this isnt the right tablet if youre looking for a high speed high performance tablet,3.0
great tablet for kids but the screen isnt as strong charging port is very poorly built,1.0
i wasnt aware of all the apps that needed a premium membership for playing music that was a disappointment but other than that i enjoy the product,3.0
so ive seen this at the mall and the tv ads and thought hmmm that sounds good note mine does not sound as good as the units ive heard play music at the stores i dont know why and there does not seem to be any adjustments you can make to that all you can do is say volume up volume down or say volume lever at no time was i told that you needed to use your smart phone and or table to down load the alexa app and then run everything through that most of the time i say alexa who is morris knight i dont know alexa was morris knight a vj on mtv i dont know alexa can you tell me who was a vj on mtv i dont know so i get i dont know more often then an get and answer if i do get an answer alexa will often give me an answer to a for a different person the person i asked aboutif you have a amazon fire stick dont ask alexa about a movie or is joan collins in the movie the virgin queen because for me anytime i use the word movie she will turn on my fire stick so if you are watching something else you are no longer watching it she can turn on the amazon fire stick but she cant put your tv back to what you were watching beforethe echo device will often tell you to go to the alexa app so im really not sure what the echo device does everything is run through the alexa app so just get your table out and use alexa that wayim just not very happy with this purchase i went to the mall and the person said bring in your tablet and i can see what is going on so see its driven by that tablet and the app right,3.0

these batteries literally only last  minutes inside of each device i put them in when i researched the product they told me the only way was to spend  on the recharger for these batteries i personally do not buy batteries to have to spend more than what i spent on them in whole to have to buy a whole other product to recharge them worst amazon product i ever wasted my money on,1.0
i like this device a lot very good battery life and like the fact this is linked to my amazon account for books and music,4.0
programming echo is time consuming i still have not gotten everything programmed that i would like we dont use it as much as i thought we would either,4.0
i purchased a galaxy phone and received the fire tablet for free i do use it to read books to my son he mostly uses it to play his games it does the job,4.0
looks like these will be good for lower drain standby applications where battery leakage is a concern i have given up on the costco brand as they tend to leak in these types of applications while overall watthour density is average still good for remotes and common applications its hyped about japanese technology but not made in japan,4.0
i got these for my  and  year old they love them,3.0
my first tablet was a kindle i was curious about the updated version very disappointed,1.0
i have had a kindle before and needed a new one as the old one would no longer charge very well still adjusting to some different features from the original one do not like the fact that it is difficult to find a case for this one,4.0
if you arent tech savvy know someone who is to be able to get alexa to respond amazon was kind enough to email me to offer support im afraid the first question will be is it plugged in im not tech savvy but i also have some sense,3.0
the whole ai question and answer dynamic is cool but the speakers are weak the bass is non existent and the treble is harsh,3.0
excellent purchase especially for the price  toddlers in the house make batteries a commodity item there are excellent reviews that compare amazonbasics to the usual battery brands i highly suggest you read them to see that there really isnt a difference and since the price is so much lower these are a no brainer,5.0

we tried these batteries out but theyre trash they lasted only  weeks in our tivo remotes which is amazing as we dont watch that much tv,1.0
we got this for our son he is always wanting to play on moms tablet so we thought this would be a good choice his aunt does a lot of tech shopping and bought this same one for his sister so we got the same one within a month the charging cord on both units quit working and shortly after that the ports became squirly so you have to hold them just right or they dont charge save your money and get a more expensive but better quality product,1.0

just bought it and not really happy i really expected more from amazon,2.0
this item is taking forever to charge and not holding the charge we may have to return i assume it is this unit and not all,3.0
as a charger it works but is nothing special with a mk  kindle fire it doesnt seem to charge any faster than the standard charger and no cable is included a kindlespecific cable must be purchased separately this is not mentioned in the descriptions,1.0
bought this as a cheaper alternative for using with kids battery lasts longer than most tablets the reason why i gave this such a mediocre rating is because you cant put a wallpaper for the lock screen you always have an ad for something amazon related which can be annoying but if its just something small for the kiddos to use good choice i wouldnt recommend for adults,3.0
keeps the kids busy with games and activities and they really like it,4.0
i wouldnt buy it againthe software doesnt seem as well integrated with the hardware on this machine i also have an echo and i dont have the same connectivity issues with it that i do with this i liked the features available with thisportability mainly with a long battery life but with plagued by connectivity issues i cant say i would recommend it i have looked at reviews online since purchasing and have discovered i am not the only one that feels this way the sound when it is connected and responding is amazing,3.0
batteries are awful might get  the life other batteries ive used will not be buying amazon batteries again,1.0
my kids use it for playing games only memory is too limited if you want to expand memory you have to buy special memory card from amazon regular cards wont work ill like the app free time to help protect the kids from what they watch and play but it is difficult and time consuming to get updates for the games they play amazon does not have the best user friendly software for their tablets they do what we get it for entertain the kids for awhile,2.0
amazing price,5.0

my mouse still works with a battery otherwise i dont think i use them for anything else ok batteries,4.0
not sure about these yet the question is whether the battery last long enough for the price that i paid for them will update later when i find out,3.0
absolute junk my devices run only    days with these batteries and probably half have been dead when i put them in my devices save your money buy duracell batteries from groupon they will stand behind less than quality batteries but amazon will not once you buy amazon batteries as has become the case with most of amazon you are on your on without a paddleamazon did send me replacement batteries however they are the same as the original ones i dont know how anyone can give a positive review just terrible,1.0
bought these batteries for my christmas gifts the month of december only lasted like months toys now need replacement batteries  i also used some for my doorbell and just now needs replacement batteries tv remote control is still working but these batteries dont last very long,3.0
we are very disappointed in the quality of amazons aa batteries they have failed  or  times in various products we own the most costlywas its use in our small wall safe in our home the  batteries failed after two months and we had to have a service open it at the tune of another example was a radio and flashlights we will have to throw the rest out,2.0

they seem fine to me,4.0
more then half did not work ,1.0
its nice  cool but it responds extremely slow compared to modern tablets  phones kindle is just too slow my expectation would be to make it faster even if i have to charge it often that would be ok secondly there should be a home button  back button on the body of kindle,3.0
although i had a roku three that did most of what i needed playstation vue isnt available but it is available on the fire tv if you have a prime membership this is probably for you if you are one of the people that dont like me this is nothing but a way for amazon to get you to buy more stuff from them you cant set the menus to only show the content that you own and the apps that you have downloaded cant be put first on the list,3.0
i love it i like to use to relax after coming from job,5.0
alexa really amazes me she learns new skills everyday,5.0
doa had to replace with other batteries what a disappointment threw them away ,1.0
this kindle is great but it requires a cover to protect the screen  its easily scratched,5.0
the voice recognition isnt great yet but it will only get better the potential is endless good sound quality,4.0
screen camera and processor dont perform too well but for the price you pay its definitely a bargain,3.0

great performance and value,5.0
i dont use it nearly as much as i could the kids love it when they ask me questions i now tell them ask alexa,5.0
these dont seem to last very long at all i used them on my light in chicken coop i replace once a week and only used it  or three times each week very dissapointed in this purchase i usually buy our batteries from costco,1.0
works well but does not offer access to the apple or android app store without the apps that i need this tablet is not as useful,3.0
works good have to be very careful with kids overall good product,4.0
not enough free programs even with a subscription to netflix etc you still have to pay for most movies shows,3.0
it does what its supposed to do turn ur tv into a smart tv altho chromecast has the upper hand because of its lack or chuggy connection to mobile phone,3.0
dont last very long,2.0
in my opinion this model is too small and feels cheap and sd card slot,3.0
bought as a gift super excited i hope it lives up to the hype cant wait til she unwraps it,5.0
overalls a great price and good processor for personal use great for small children value and size,5.0
i bought this because i have ebooks in college not only could i not get my ebook i called the school it department they could not either my semester was already started the sales representative at the store told me this is what i needed i ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than  minutes with the schools it department help,1.0
mistakenly bought these thinking they were a better quality of their rechargeable batteries they actually do better in my electric toothbrush than energizer its faster and they last longer definitely my battery of choice where rechargeable batteries wont do glad i accidentally bought them lol,5.0
these fire tv boxes are a bit bigger then the fire stick but carry much more processing power and memory there is virtually no lag when using the standard fire apps and only a small amount when using rd party apps kodi there are tons of tutorial online to get the most out of your fire tv,4.0
cheap batteries poor performance i put two in our roku remote and they died within a day same thing happened with the tv remote,1.0
i bought this thinking that i needed it but i didnt so it was a waste of money i do so hate to waste money the kindle can hook to a regular cell phone charger and it comes with a cable that connects to the computer for some reason i thought i just had to have this too when i bought my kindle,1.0
i think this is one of the coolest devices on the market things i like the most is that you can control all of your smart home devices with the echo,5.0
just an average alexa option does show a few things on screen but still limited,3.0
i bought these because of all the ratings on amazon but they dont last at all i am so disappointed i used the in every device and every solar light and withing  months i have to replace them all now with the the snow and cold my yard is dark because i cant get out there i will never buy these again,1.0
first had the fire stick and i heard the box was much faster i bought it and as soon as i plugged in and got started i was able to see how fast and smooth it worked great product,5.0
were happy with alexa we shuttle it from place to place without a problem i just had higher expectations but we still enjoy it,4.0

i bought this tablet as a replacement for my wifes fire tv hdx  as her battery life is starting to decrease as it is getting older unfortunately she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise the next step is  which is way too big and has  less hours of battery life and i was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode hevc like the fire tv  boxes we have connected to our televisions this unfortunately is a show stopper as we cant view the movie library we have on this tablet we will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved,2.0
i bought and returned this item i was hoping to be able to watch different sports games via the internet with the amazon fire tv but everything i selected stated it wasnt available after trying different things for a few days i figured i wasnt going to get the results i wanted and returned the unit,3.0
weve tried several of these little streamer boxes  fire tv roku apple tv not the newest one i think the roku is my favorite this one is competent if you have amazon prime youll miss it on the apple tv but the voice command mode  the one distinguishing feature of the fire  is not useful it only searches amazon content and while amazon has a lot of stuff we watch more on netflix hbo showtime hulu etc so not so useful i would get the roku the remote with headphones is a great feature,3.0
as other reviewer commented thank you these batteries expiration date was  years off when we purchased them weve not had any problems with any of them many applications just do not do well with those rechargeable batteries so these fit the bill nicely,4.0
alexa is the best if you can get past your kids asking her every question that comes to mind great product,5.0
everything started out great but then about  days into owning the fire could not locate wifi doesnt work without wifi,2.0
the screen breaks way to easy it drop one time broke,1.0
has a very good bluetooth speakers sound quality is good but otherwise shes pretty useless when it comes to get answering questions,1.0
i had this device for few weeks before returning it and getting the kindle voyage but the only difference between the two is the design page press buttons and the auto dimming light as they both have the same screen after purchasing this device i immediately devoured three books in the course of a weekend which sadly is more than ive read in about two years this device has reinvigorated my live for reading since it is so portable and the battery lasts for quite a while i would suggest that you get the genuine leather cover for this device when you buy it as it just adds that little extra to the purchase overall i would recommend anyone that wants to read more reads often or reads many books at once to take the plunge and buy this device plus new books can be upwards of  sometimes this little device will carry all of your books and only costs the price of a few hard copy books plus if you need a physical copy you can always borrow from the library,4.0
while these surely dont last as long as big brand batteries they are a good substitute when your kids have  toys that required  batteries a piece they do the job and power those things up just as any other battery brand would,4.0
this is a quick and responsive tablet apps are limited to the amazon store for the most part so its important to make sure the apps you want are both available on amazon and compatible with this tablet,4.0
i love this tablet and the games but battery sucks it goes dead really fast and it freezes up a lot,3.0
 of the package have been duds lasted about  minutes now i get to go to the trouble to return them when you shop with amazon its to save time this defeats that purpose,1.0
no worries  grade a  works well looks good say no more ,5.0
bought this for our daughter to use but nothing worked right and was difficult to use its a fairly cheap  product and it shows ended up returning it and buying a samsung the next day,1.0
honestly the worst tablet ever owned was very slow and unreliable would switch off,1.0
i like the tablet for ease of use its a little slow in my opinion battery is good,4.0
picked this up for my  year old and he picked it up faster than i did,5.0
i have a roku tuner and am not impressed with iy i find the amazon tuner much easier to find programs,4.0
broke the screen on our nd gen fire so this is its replacement easy setup much faster than older one just the right size for games email social media,5.0
i think that this tablet is only good for reading books its not very fast so you wont be able to do anything else,3.0
i like the amazon firetv more than the firestick,5.0
bought for my son he really liked it for a starter tablet,3.0
i purchased these to try because i needed so many for my christmas village withing  hours some of the batteries died so i turned off all of them so i could at least have them on for christmas i am very disappointed in them had to go out and purchase more of the copper top ones which last weeks and weeks to keep my village lit for the holidays i will not purchase these again,2.0
had one before but it went wacky after  years seems to work well so far,4.0
this is a pretty reliable tablet especially for the price,4.0
cheap batteries yo,5.0
i love how alexa can control almost all smart things and help control lights and power on and off devices to help us get ready for the day the music is connected directly to amazon prime music and i love how the sound is clear and crisp you can call out to alexa from far away and sheäôll add items to your shopping list and the alexa app is so simple to view the lists and control your smart things,5.0
the juice in these batteries arent long term,3.0
just my  opinion but i like the apple tv better just easier to use,3.0
the kindle works as it should and was inexpensive but has a short battery life,3.0
needed a tablet for games and apps for the elderly great choice,4.0
i dont read the books im still learning about it i dont really even use it,3.0
i am sure alexa does many things but so far she hasnt reached her full potential user needs to learn to implement her skills,3.0
i am not impressed at all i think you should save your money and get a smart watch instead this is a expensive item and doesnt do enough for the money you spent the weather timers adding things to your calendar thats just not enough half the things you ask her she said she doesnt understand,2.0
just wish it would learn faster seems like the google home has better knowledge with internet info,3.0
great easy to use tablet grabbed it for my daughter and she cant get enough gets the job done ,5.0
i purchased this amazon fire because reviews are good but i realized they left reviews before they receive iti found couple of issues not to buy this tablet it is impossible to use google accounteven you can log in gmail account bad for web surfing there are so many limits for web surfingthis issue is only for koreans it is impossible to type  see korean languagedo not buy this tablet if you are koreani do not know why this tablet does not support korean even supports other asian countries languages as like chinese japanese etc,1.0
terrible barely lasted three hours during a digital camera shoot where duracell lasts multiple days,2.0
im constantly getting updates on how they are making the echo great it will take time but needs to also integrate with phone to send and receive calls and text messages hate having to tell it what rd part app to integrate with also good for smarthome features,3.0
traded in the echo for google home after trying both did the training questions but still found it could only answer  of  questions there were many specific apps but trying to remember the cues words is more difficult google home answers without cue words the first time and can extend a conversation based on the first question can ask for driving times to destinations without an app same for getting a cocktail recipe very dry responses where gh has personality try them both before deciding what is best for your needs,3.0
simply amazing forgot how much i love having music on in the background during the day and with access to prime playlists its an outstanding deal weather forecasts whos that actor that was in set an alarm for a reminder add items to shopping list trivia questionsyou name it alexa does it tell her goodnight and she responds kindly with goodnight been on the fence for awhile about purchasing this and now i am so glad i went for it,5.0
it works great with the our new kindle,5.0
the amazon  fire hd     tablet  gb was delivered quickly setup was easy as we already have another kindle fire and the unit is terrific for our use web browsing youtube videos the unit is fast screen is very clear and battery is good,5.0
the technology just keeps getting better and better,4.0
like this version the best the new version does not give you much of a choice for colors and you can get a skin for the st generation version the speaker is great fills the room with sound replaced an echo dot which suckedwouldnt stay connected to the external speaker always having to pair it or reconnect it to the internet etc plugged this one in and it worked right away,5.0
i had to buy it what else is there to say,1.0
i enjoy the product it was easy to program my toddler pushed a button that changed the setting i took the product to the store and the kind salesman corrected the product,4.0
i use this to read things and purchase items on amazon it doesnt play all of my favorite games from the app store nor does it sync to my android projector so i dont really get full use of the larger screen i think for my uses i shouldve just purchased the eink version or maybe a fullandroid version,2.0
was not sure what to expect as im generally not too savvy with technology this amazon echo product is fairly easy to get started using and can be really helpful when you are multi tasking i normally dont have a free hand and when you cant have your tablet with you at all times the amazon echo fills that void quickly i would suggest everyone with the internet to have one of these in their homes,5.0
the tablet was bought for a few family members two of which have bought several kindle books but only the price is the only note worthy thing about it if you buy it for  bucks you have pay another  to remove the ads and since this is from amazon there is no google play to get more app selectiontrue you can try to side load the google apps but the average tablet buyer wont do this also the battery life is poor compared to tablets like the ipad mini or other decent android slates id recommend a samsung tablet or an ipad before i would recommend this unless you have a very specific use for it and did not want to spend a lot of money,2.0
the only reason i chose  star is because of size the length is disproportionate to the width awkward when holding it,1.0
it is good so far will update again if need to,4.0
i decided i wanted to try a tablet for reading books and a little social media instead of using my phone all the time i researched the fire  and fire hd  and settled on the  knowing that it is a low end device the device is slick and easy to use and the alexa integration is really cool but its a  tablet at times the performance is awful slow i suspect it is updating content say on twitter or fb my complaint is when it is doing this there are no visuals to let you know it is busy i finally got on amazons chat feature and several hours later including several power cycles and a complete factory restore the performance is the same the reps at amazon tried their best  and fwiw i knew there was nothing they could do to speed it up before i contacted them but i thought i would give it a try so get this if you want just be patient remember its a  tablet if you want better performance spend more ,3.0

i know not everyone wants to read a direct comparison to an apple tv rather than a review on the moerits of this device but i have owned both and stuck with the apple tv instead of thisthe apps i used directv now netflix amazon prime video choked and buffered much more often or froze completely the wifi reception was also sub parthe remote is good and i prefer the batteries approach to apples rechargeable one everything else though the apple tv seemed to do bettermy two cents still a solid streaming device and the price is better than apples i would make the decision based on how plugged into amazons ecosystem you are vs apples,4.0

when i got my kindle fire i got a protective cover for it and figured id be ok because i dont travel much at all am bedriddendisabled from car accidents after a while i couldnt get the miniusb cord to stay in the plug on the kindle after describing the problem to amazon they sent me a new cord i got the newer one with an ac plug and had to pay for it unfortunately this did not solve the problem and i had to mail them my kindle and they shipped me a new one configured mostly the way i had everything before i sent it which was very convenient using my new cable purchased through the amazon kindle store i had no problems at firstwith only very light use primarily for reading books for short intervals the problem i had before with the mini usb plug on the kindle not fitting tightly into its socket after changing up ac to usb as well as trying both usbs on my computer i was unable to get the kindle to start because it had less than  charge on the battery but i had no way to charge it the only way to resolve the issue would be to go through the procedure described above i read a number of the positive reviews which are usually posted first and nothing was mentioned about this problemthere were so many reviews i didnt have the time to go through them all im in the middle of a book and use the kindle to play scrabble with a friend and were in the middle of a gameso i havent decided what to do yet its after  am sunday morning so i cant call the kindle store for advicei had been considering upgrading to one of the new kindle products but after having this recurring problem i am leery of spending that kind of money only to possibly have the same issueread more,2.0

device does not stay connected to wifi always disconnecting this makes product unusable for alarms and timers when used to work with harmony at times does not turn on all devices over priced and overrated purchased google home for the past week it has not lost contact with wifi and works perfectly with harmony hub difficult setup with echo even with  times with echo support they cant figure it out wish i could return not too late,1.0

the best tablet that i bought and the best gifffft,5.0
these did not fit my device,1.0
currently this is the fifth version of the kindle fire that i purchased since they came out purchased this one due to its ability to maximize storage with a sd card unlike the other ones i have it seemed to not run as smooth as my kindle fire hdx once i started adding apps to it which is not a problem for me since i use other tablets for that this was mainly purchased to download shows and movies from amazon prime to watch offline,4.0

havent personally used this tablet but my niece likes it,4.0
these batteries are terrible all of my clocks bought in this same order need new batteries already because they are all dying i now have to buy all energizer batteries ,1.0
this pillow is made of memory foam but it is rock hard it actually made my neck pain worse the reason im giving it two stars instead of one is that the fabric feels nice and seems well made this may work for some people but not me,2.0
three star due to the fact that sometimes the fire tv remote doesnt work i will then use my smart tv remote other than that issue i would give five star,3.0
beware these batteries  i just packed them up for returning hated to have to do so but they lasted only  hours in tiny flashlights for my grand kids  big disappointment too  wont buy this brand batteries againnor do i recommend them to anyone out there ,1.0
the amazon  fire tv worked great our needs it has all the features we liked,4.0
the white echo is nicelooking and subtle on the countertop the sound quality is the best feature basic voice commands are best is it raining other commands need effort what are cumulus clouds sorry i dont know that,3.0
my wife wanted an ipad i bought her this because it was cheaper and good for reading and playing games she uses ios products so its not compatible she hardly ever uses it next time ill get what she wants and not waste my money,2.0

this echo simplifies my daily life activities and is worth every penny,5.0
i like the ipad its very helpful my son has learned alot and i hope that it will help other kids too as they prepare for pre k,3.0

ive always been a roku user but when directv now came out recently and wasnt available on roku but was on fire tv i gave it a try ive been very happy with it and have switched all my rokus out with fire tvs,5.0
these dont last long wont be buying anymore wish they had been better,2.0
its seems as thought all of the batteries in the package are already dead they are only lasting  days in the devices im putting them in fairly disappointed,1.0
i wanted to like this a lot because my ipad mini is heavy to carry in my purse all the time this is so very light but they make you jump through hoops to get rid of all the advertising on the device and when you buy it at best buy you are not given a choice to spend an extra  on a  dollar book or put up with their ads i had to go through being on hold forever to get someone to help get this off my device so that was an immediate turnoff i dont find it to pageturn handle as well as my old original nook or nook color and certainly not anything like the ipad mini if i hadnt kept it too long to return i would have it doesnt auto correct to landscape then portrate nope you have to manually choose one or the other and going back and forth is just stupidit should have been part of the improved design they really missed the mark for the price i can get a full tablet for less money that does all that and simply use the kindle appproslight weightsmall for purseback lightconscomes preloaded with adsnot easy to get them off if you buy device in a storepage control is not that simplet doesnt auto turn from landscape to portrate you have to set it to one or the othernot as touch responsive to anythingdont like the organization of it,2.0
the is an entry level tablet for those who are looking for a budget tablet i believe you can only access to amazon app store  which has fewer apps as compared to apple store and google play,4.0
first one died within hours of setting it up returned and reluctantly got a second this one has been solid so far,4.0
i dont understand why these are rated so highly  these batteries do not last i have never experienced batteries that died so quicklyi used them from everything to my computer mouse to microphone and they lasted maybe about  the time of what im used to i guess you get what you pay for  would never order these again,1.0
i love to read but i rarely have time these days for those who do have the time this is a great device because you can take it anywhere and read it easily in pretty much any lighting situation the text is crisp and easy to see but i wish the screen was just a little bigger i ultimately took this back and went with a kindle fire hd  the pros of a tablet outweighed the cons for my situation but the kindle paperwhite is still a great option for people who read a lot and want to read their books anywhere they go,4.0
jury still out only recently used a couple,3.0
disappointed with screen brightness i would not recommend it and yes i adjusted the screen to maximum,2.0
i didnt realize even though i should have that i could not add whatever programs i wanted to for it i wanted to get this so i could play games on the tablet while home instead of my phone i was able to install one of the two games i play but was unable to with the second i will actually be returning it because that means i have no use for it my wife has one and hers has been great for her this entire time,3.0
update  purchased product again and they are working in the devices that they did not work in prior also i believe the batteries are lasting longer than the batteries i purchased prior maybe fresher when they work they work great i have a number of devices that for whatever reason they do not power up with these batteries i can replace with a non amazonbasics battery and it starts working i do not see any difference in length circumferenceetc so not sure what is going on with that said they work great in this devices where there is not a compatibility problem,3.0
i like the echo for the intelligence that alexa brings i wish it had sound quality that matched that of my sonos or rather the sonos had the smarts of the echo either way i dont regret buying the device,4.0
after setting up the amazon fire it froze on me and i had to return it ,1.0
its okjust okhate the ads and the home screennot as good as original,4.0
i have to admit i was not too happy with these and probably wont buy them again the life on them is extremely short and definitely leave a lot to be desired,2.0
this is a great tablet for ages  and up my son can watch videos play games its perfect for him,4.0
i love this device i have an amazon prime membership netflix and slingtv and this allows me to utilize all three easily,5.0
its a good tablet for the price considering it was only  not the best quality but suitable for my kids to enjoy,3.0
i got this gift for the wife for a starter tablet and she loves it,4.0
tablet is ok it does display ads on the lock screen that you cant opt out of to my knowledge but for the price i cant really complain i bought it at the  bf price i wouldnt let me download instagram for some reason either,3.0
if you have prime this is the device love it get yourself one for sure no prime maybe not so much,5.0
its a little slow and the camera isnt the best but for the price its fine,3.0
the kindles keep getting better and better i purchased this for my son who is an avid reader he loves it and i love that he is reading more,4.0
wasnt sure if my nontechie family member would get much use out of this but still gave it to them as a birthday gift i was so wrong to underestimate how much they would enjoy this product they cant stop raving about it they loved it so much that they also bought the echo dot to use in their bedroom they like how simple and easy this is to setup and use,5.0
they seem to die faster than most batteries,3.0
i purchased this to watch playstation vue which it does very well it is relatively small and does to make any noise that i can detect,5.0
its great battery thanks amazon,5.0
i originally looked at a samsung in the store to purchase for my just turned  year old the salesperson talked me into buying this tablet it would be great for an older child as the learning games preloaded are pretty advanced they are way over my childs head and he is advanced for his age i thought that i might just be able to go to the playstore and download the learning games that i wanted from there but it will not let me access that very disappointed we dont really even use it maybe next year,2.0
i purchased this thinking it would be a cheaper tablet for my son with great graphics it is exactly that,4.0
i bought this tablet because it seemed worth it for the price however it only lasted  months before the battery died and was not chargeable regardless of troubleshooting and what cord or outlet i usedbest buy said they couldnt do anything but said amazon could help me since it should be under warranty i escalated multiple times with amazon and they refused to help me each time so save your  and put it towards a good product,1.0
batteries last for about  days in my xbox one controller,1.0
so i purchased a pack of these a month ago dec and was using them as expected when i hit a snag at least  batteries from this pack were marginalundervoltage v out of the box i found this out because i had replaced a pair of batteries in one of my remote sensors for my wall mounted indoor weather station because the had sensor stopped working i thought maybe i had inserted them wrong but no the  marks matched the batteries so i tried several times to reset both the sensor and the station with no luck at one point i had all of the batteries out to force a reset and put them back but now my weather station would not power up eitherthat was the clue i needed i got my trusty multimeter with battery tester and checked out all  of the amazon basics aa cells like all new v batteries most of them showed v which is typical two of them were at v which was just low enough for them to be considered undervoltage no new aa battery should arrive with v this is the first and only time i have ever seen fresh batteries arrive in a not as new condition with caused problems with my electronicsi generally like all of the various amazon basics products mice hdmi cables etc but this has caused me to have doubts about not only their aa batteries but all of the house branded products buyer beware caveat emptor seems to be the bottom line,2.0
batteries kick ass just as good as name brand would purchase again,5.0
this works great it is a great way to get rid of cable,5.0
this device is a good if you are looking for a starter tablet for a young individual,3.0
we must have gotten a defective lot because these have caused every fire alarm in the house to sound within days of installing these batteries too late to return so much for  year shelf life,1.0
good tablet for my grand kid had to replace defective one but otherwise great gorgeous his use,5.0
used it for  days and the screen froze  timesthe kindle just wont switch on had to restart each time and sometimes restarting wont help it is clearly defective brought it to a bestbuy store to exchange but custumer service wont replace it asked me to look on the kindle shelf and there was none then they said they could give me store credit and i would go line up in checkout and order a new one since i got mine on a discount i had to pay the price difference this is ridiculous they wouldnt order a replacement for a defective product unless i pay more got a refund in the end even though i liked the product otherwise and would much prefer an exchange i guess purchases with discounts are not protected,1.0
a little slow loading compared to my hdx which just had the screen broken so needed a less expensive replacement great for reading books of course,4.0
this was a replacement for my son whos original kindle broke he likes it a lot just wish we could figure out how to get all the old content we had bought from the old one into the new one,3.0
i bought  of these and gave them to my nice and nephews for their christmas gift they are a awesome tablet for the price,5.0
i do most of my things on my laptop but i wanted something to use while watching tv and so on i saw this tablet and had to look twice because i thought maybe it was just a reader i have used this installing apps playing games reading texting on a free text app facebooking and so on the apps are a little sluggish to install but once they are on they are speedy and work well the clearness of the screen is so much better than any low line tablet at this price range the tablet feels of good quality it is not flimsy and cheap feeling we bought two and are extremely happy the trick is not to expect it to run like and upper line tablet love it for what it is ,4.0
good for the price but whatever in quality i guessdont last too long,4.0

i purchased this tablet a week ago as a gift for my brother and it has restarted itself over ten times and has shut off while someone was on in on different occasions will be getting my money back and getting a samsung,2.0
very user friendly easy set up and works great with my amazon prime account,5.0
bought this for my parents as they have an aging rd generation firehd that tablet cost well over  dollars but was limited to fireos  i couldnt believe that their newest only cost  on sale with ads i dont think it is worth it at their normal price of  dollarsfireos  is pretty much just a skinned version of android lolipop since we are on nougat now they are about two years behind hopefully security updates are still being made for the devicethe biggest disappointment was the screen if you buy this for reading books they really need to go back to the old  gen hd fire tablets as their screens are so much better they claim ips on this screen but i dont buy it colors are washed out and pixel density is pretty poorthe blue light filter they have is pretty terrible compared to what apple offers it basically puts a semitransparent color over the entire screen if something on the screen is already black why does it need to look blackish orange i dont fully fault amazon as this may be more of a limitation of android but stillalso i cant figure out how to get rid of the adds for the red version in the past there was an option to pay a few extra dollars and they remove the promotion amazons website doesnt offer the red without adds as of this writing but they do with the blackside load google play store for more up to date apps as a lot of the amazon store apps are long out of date,3.0
this is a good device i initially bought the google home i was very dissatisfied with it i returned it and bought amazon echo i am happy with it i have had some difficulty a few times getting it to recognize my voice but it is a very good unit i am still learning what all it can do,4.0
been going through a pair a week in my xbox one controller i play about  hrs a day average so the performance is underwhelming,2.0
echo is a great addition to the home especially since we have wemo products in the house and able to control lights throughout the house by simply telling alexa great sound in the kitchen to listen to music with amazons prime music library,5.0
some are not functioning,1.0
this thing is ok next time we get electronics it will be amason,3.0
the batteries are sligtly bigger and will not fit in some electronics i thought aa was the standard size nope i was wrong but the good news is i now am the proud owner of  slightly oversized batteries that do not fit in most of my battery operated devices perfect out of  reviews nobody noticed the size issue with these,1.0

its  bucks there is no better tablet for that price range toss in prime and its even better,4.0
very good price for batteries and they work flawlessly unfortunately they dont come in their own container to keep them together after opening this means you need to have a small ziploc or something to store them in or you are just going to have a bunch of loose batteries rolling around all over the place,3.0
kindle fire is a decent tablet the only turn off is the way amazon has massacred the android os and makes it incompatible with chromecast most of the time its a great tablet for reading and saving media on the go other than the os kindle fire is a decent buy,3.0

my mother in law owns a home decor store with a lot of battery operated things like clocks etc we ordered these for her and she spent hours putting them in things all around the store once they were on they only lasted about  minutes she then had to go back and take them all out and go out and buy different batteries really disappointing and a huge hassle for her have never had batteries last such a short time we were very unhappy,1.0
works great allows the use of cat  and wireless use,5.0
i purchased them thinking they would be a great value based on other reviews i have an alarm keypad among other things that i use them in previously batteries would last about a year in the keypad these batteries will last about a month before they die the first time it happened i thought there could have been a bad battery or possibly my memory was failing me after  sets in  months there is no doubt the batteries test fully charged when i install them and then a month later they are gone that is not a great value at all i will find another battery for future use,1.0

this really isnt a very good tablet by any measure other than bang for your buck i bought this for about  just to kill time on a couple of long flights so i didnt wear out the battery on my phone i definitely wouldnt recommend using this for reading as the screen resolution is really below average and be tough to look at i only used it to read some comics and play games on a screen bigger than a phone so i got what i wanted out of it,2.0
for  dollars its a great option although it was a black friday special its perfect for kids especially considering the amount of damage it can handle,3.0
i have been very pleased with my voyage it operates as advertised and has been a pleasure to use very well pleased with battery life,4.0
i was worried that it would have lag but it didnt i got this to replace my kindle paperwhite which i still love because i wanted to be able to listen to the audio on the books as well its a great little tablet that does so much of what i wanted it to do the stand by time and play time are better than i thought they would be as well i love the blue light filter although that takes time to get used to it if your not already accustomed to that sort of thing the only other thing i really dont care for is the fact you can not easily add google play store,4.0

not all that long life,3.0
i picked this one up to replace an older one that had stopped working i like the back lite and its not a bad size,4.0
theres a lot of space with the amazon basics laptop and a number of great compartments but the material its made from feels kind of stiff and inexpensive i was impressed at how much i could get into this backpack but once it was packed it felt very big and bulky my normal backpack is a smaller one from timberline which has less compartments but seems to hold a great deal of stuff and not feel nearly as bulky as this one,3.0

bestbuy was offering some discounts during thanksgiving and this prompted me to buy i was not an avid before and just casually bought this product but i must admit i am not at all disappointed with this works best with english books does not work that well with native books also this product is not backlit and does not have any option to increase the screen brightness and i would deduct  star for that you need to install another product called calibre in your computer to convert books to kindle readable format mobi kindle can also read pdf but mobi format is better readable compared to kindle,4.0
