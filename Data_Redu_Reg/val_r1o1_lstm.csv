bought this to replace my aging nexus   version but didnt hold a candle up to it i knew it going in but wanted to see for myself in person for  cant hardly beat the features but i was spoiled by arguably the best small android tablet ever made i knew the screen resolution was lacking especially on an  screen but coming from the nexus it was a huge difference also even at  plus years old the processor was humming along smoothly the extra  gb ram was also helpful anyways back to the fire hd  one advantage it had over the nexus was the expansion slot i loved being able to put my media on it but then again the media displayed on the screen was subpar so its a wash i installed google play on it so that it expanded its functionality and im an avid amazon conneseiur but found the table too limiting ultimately returned and bought an old discontinued fire hd  for  the resolution almost matches that of the nexus so im happy for now,3.0,neutral

this tablet is good for the price just be aware there is adware that cannot be removed unless you pay amazon  there are other tablets available at a similar price without the adware if you are not interested in amazon products or services if you are looking for an android tablet will be disappointed this tablet has an android operating system but it is not available due to the amazon operating system overriding it the screen resolution is average if you are an amazon user this is a good tablet otherwise look elsewhere,3.0,neutral

purchased the tablet for my  month old daughter since i notice that she loves phone screens and tablets keep in mind isnt intend for kids her age but make sure there is adult supervision pluses the tablet can take a good beating tons of hard tapping and even with the tough case can even take biting as well without causing any damage to the pink case  daughter is teething lol  im a amazon prime memberwhich gives access to tons of shows and free apps so if you have prime you can totally take advantage of a full library of entertainment some of the apps are great even for my  month old daughter works great to keep her entertained also when she is older i have tons of options to change and control also i get my own side she cant do anything unless i give her actioncons average battery life hours tops of nonstop use and also wish that there was a way to lock the screen while watching amazon netflix or any other video app so when my daughter taps in any direction or anywhere that the videos wouldnt stop playing,4.0,positive

i have an old kindle touch the last one that still had texttovoice which no longer works i decided to upgrade started reading the reviews was enticed by the the kindle voyage and took the plunge the voyage is pretty and sleek with neat features and i enjoyed using it for a few days but my frugal self just couldnt justify the price difference between it and the paperwhite while the ambient light sensor was nice i often ended up just adjusting it manually because it was still a little bright in a completely dark room i made more errors of turning a page than i meant to with the page turn because of where the page turn spots are located plus im in the habit of flipping pages on the phone or a tablet so i kept swiping despite the availability of page turn however the clarity of the screen the quality of the light the form factor the weight and the way it felt in my hand while reading were all very nice nonetheless the price difference bothered me enough to return it and get the paperwhite the thing i miss most about the voyage is the quality of the light and how even the lighting is on it the unit i had did not have blank spots or a yellowish top half of the page or any of the lighting issues some reviewers mentioned with the voyage i purchased the newest model of the paperwhite and i like it but the lighting appears pretty dingy however its only when theyre compared sidetoside that i wished i wasnt so cost conscious if money is not an object id say get the kindle voyage if it is the paperwhite is a fine little reader and overall im happy i have it,4.0,positive

the echo is a nice speaker that has the added bonus of being able to respond to questions and give sometimes useful information however in regards to it being capable of serving as the brain of an integrated automated home it lacks much i purchased it to use with philips hue bulbs and i was hoping my fire tv although it shares the same software with the fire and logically should be able to work together it does not echo will not connect to or control the tv as far as the philips hue bulbs it can turn on individual bulbs or even a group of bulbs if and only if you remember the exact phrase or name you gave it it cannot dim the lights set light scenes or any of the cooler options the philips hue bulbs are capable of i wound up going back to using my iphone which respond to voice command of hey siri better than the echo anyway if i had to do it over again i would have saved the money and gone with a simple bluetooth speaker for my phone as it can already do many of the things the echo does only difference is that the phone doesnt have as big of a range for voice pickupi did give the echo three stars because the one thing it does well is respond to questions like whats the weather like that feature is interesting but not worth paying nearly  for,3.0,neutral
