have had it for a while noe a littlebit unusual to press so hard to change page but now starting to get used to it,3.0
decent batteries but do not seem to last that long in electronics,3.0
works exactly as expected i bought this in an effort to convert my old flatscreen with no smart capabilities into a smart tv definitely got the job done,5.0
fun gadget plays songs various entertainment still learning all it can do,4.0
i did read about the game prior to buying it but so far the game is only half decent too much of the same thing,3.0
basically has almost the same content as a roku  would provide but in a much more clunkier menu i can get a better amazon menu layout via the amazon app on the roku  also for those that were hoping to pick up some extra football via fox sports network fs that is not happening you can add the channel free but in order to watch any content you will still need a cable or satellite subscription which defeats the whole purpose of adding the app for us cord cutters there is no way i am signing back up for cable or satellite i wish fs would get with the program and offer a separate subscription such as hbo and showtime do its a thumbs down for me,1.0
we all love alexa you can play games like jeopardy or would you rather family edition the kids love to have alexa tell them jokes,4.0

bought this device to stream netflix amazon prime and to play downloaded content for that purpose it is sufficient i wouldnt use a fire tablet as a productivity device as it is seriously underpowered fire tablet bogged down pretty quickly when i attempted to multitask bottomline this is not an ipad replacement  particularly if you like to do a variety of things on your tablet but at  on sale this was a very good deal for my purposes,3.0

the price of the item was very good compared to other cages however the item itself came tilted so now my dog has a tilted dog crate the tilt to the gates are noticeable but not very drastic for the price ill live with it,3.0
this was advertised as the latest version  my ignorance led me to its  price i thought they were all paperwite  as in just like white paper in a book bought it for my wife i returned mine as a refused shipment and ordered the paperwhite it has a backlight higher resolution and for  worth it kindler ,3.0
if you just want to watch movies or shop it does the job not enough memory to do much else but for the price its great for kids,3.0
the echo is not very good at answering questions it is good at playing music and telling you the weather im sure it will get better but it is more of an annoyance with a toddler in the house it does tell cute jokes but it says im sorry i cant find that answer more often than not the sound is quite good from this model and works well with spotify,3.0
i am very disappointed in these batteries they do not work or if they do work it is only for a few minutes they are a waste of money,1.0

i bought a kindle fire gb for my  year old son in june after  months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge best buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it amazon will not warranty their product for more than  days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them they have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if i buy a new one amazon does not stand behind this product they are aware of the defect and continue to sell these,1.0
if you want an inexpensive device to read kindle books or do email this is it,3.0
its a decent quality tablet for the money one complaint is the speakers are weak have to cup my hand around the speaker side to get some good feedback the silk browser seems to have issues with search engines just switching the search engine fixes it thoughi got this for when the power goes out at my house its served to let me watch netflix with a bluetooth keyboard it seems adequate for messaging and writing out notesvideo quality is good enough though that has more to do with not being super picky about it im considering gifting my dad one of these this year he commented that the quality looked good another complaint would be the amazon app store is limited no clash royale which is the only mobile game i actually enjoy im sure theres a way around this but im really not interested in digging around for it so for the most part its a good solid low end tablet,3.0
very very very difficult to turn on and off not sticky enough and kept falling down complete waste of moneywhen i could get them on and they were sticking the lighting effect was very nice however the quality of the product was zero,1.0
got these for my  and  year old on black friday when they were  typically our household is apple only but i couldnt justify buying another ipad works great not as many of her favorite apps as the ipad but still a hit,4.0
i didnt do any in depth research on this particular tablet the price and speed were good for what i wanted it for my only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so i can see my personal home screen picture,3.0

they work but dont last too long cant complain though i wanted batteries and i received batteries yay,4.0
good tablet to purchase for a first time tablet user,3.0
very satisfied with the product i have one for each of my kids now and for that the price point is amazing i have a pretty big beef with best buys in store customer service at this point i ordered a different color to help keep my kids kindles separated between them the color i ordered for my  year old came in but they sent the  gig rather than the  gig instead of giving me the color my  year old ordered the customer service agent behind the counter absolutely insisted that they couldnt do that and canceled the order making me take one of the colors we already had and at least temporarily disappointing my  year old son who did not get the color he had wanted very very dissatisfied with best buy customer service on this and this insadent will make me question some of my future purchases with best buy,4.0
sorry amazon you guys are great at what you do by selling your products at reasonable prices and good no hassle returns and i am a very happy customer but i purchased a box each of your aaa aa and d cell batteries i have used the aaas for remotes with no apparent problems so far i have not used the d cells yet but the aa batteries are the worst batteries i have ever used they dont last long in my flash lights my son had four batteries that actually blew up inside the unit i heard a loud pop while the unit was playing after five minutes or so i wanted to know what happened and looked inside the unit and the green  negative containment ringsealer had blown out and acid was all over the inside of the unit i had to throw the rest of these batteries in the trash because i am worried about my little ones getting acid on them amazon your good name should not be on those bad batteries,1.0
i saw reviews for batteries on the news and these were rated among best im so glad i can get these from amazon in bulk for a great price,5.0
good one to configure everything ina easy way thanks,4.0
i have two google home devices they seem to be lacking in smart home controls now i find out that additional devices are necessary to use echo in a smarthome configuration although currently somewhat limited i expect that google home will surpass the echo with addon smarthome devices ill wait rather then buy these devices twice,2.0

got this tab for my  year old daughter shes always on my phone or tablet so got her her very own it has all the functions and apps she likes and uses not to hard to use and gets the job done for the right price she is  so she will drop and be rough with the tablet seems sturdy enough and not expensive that its going to break the bank if she damages it,4.0
batteries popped open inside the motion detector lights making a mess and ruining the detector i will never buy this brand again,1.0
sweet tablet yo does good work for my grandma and super easy,4.0
i use these in a three battery work light and probably  times per  one dies much more quickly than the others i put them on a meter and  have v left but the third has around v frustrating but i think theyre still a good value,3.0
got an unbelievable deal the best part is having a library of books at my fingertips easy and simple to set up and great when im traveling,5.0
this makes my phone way to big cant fit in pockets,1.0
tablet itself is good i mostly use it to read on the go however this tablet only works with amazon approved apps as long as you dont mind it this is a good choice get it on sale for a better price,3.0
ive used these exclusively for my two xbox one controllers and have not tried any other batteries in them they lasted for about  hours of play time before running out that seemed quick to me but i dont have anything to compare it to these were the right price i will order again when i remember to order batteries before i need them,4.0
they are terrible,1.0
cheap batteries for the win they work they last a reasonable amount of time i cant compare to other brands because i dont track batteries that closely but they last long enough for me i would buy again,5.0
good batteries,4.0
so slow returning mine for something different any suggestions,1.0
we love this table for our  yo it gives him the sense of independence he wants and me the sense of calmness knowing i can control what he gets on and how long he can spend in screen time,4.0
easy to use quick setup fantastic screen and the colors are vibrant,5.0
pros you can get a lot of batteries for a very cheap pricecons batteries do not last very long at alli dont mind changing out batteries on something i use constantly since i got the hundred back but it can get a little annoying doing it once a week i bought these specifically for my xbox one controller which is used daily for an hour or two on average,3.0
a real nice tablet for children and got it on sale at bestbuy,4.0
this does not give great answers and the connection is not that great exchanging for a google home,2.0
easy to read in any light battery seems to last forever size  weight easy to carry along everywhere,5.0
it didnt work i had to return it after christmas and buy something else made for a wonderful christmas mourning,1.0
i should have done some research before buying the tap i would have rather had the upgraded version that is voice activated also i thought it would be more like siri where you can ask anything alexas answer to most questions is i dont understand the question the bluetooth speaker works fine,2.0
so far ive had my fire tablet for over a month its my first tablet the lack of the googlke play store means the amazon apps are pretty limited but i found avway around that the front camera is grainy but acceptance while using skype battery doesnt last long and it seems to take hours to recharge for a  first tablet i suppose those are acceptable flaws feels robust in the hand though the plastic casing reminds you of its materials if you hold it tight,4.0
works great nice upgrade over the fire stick as it has an ethernet port heavily focused on amazon content duh but if you have a prime account this is a must,4.0
this edition does not have backlighting which is a big deal if you like reading in bed or indoors without needing to use external lighting you should not get this version get one of the newer editions if you only read in well lit areas then go for this one kindle is fantastic and i love my white lightweight long lasting kindle with the option to use background light,2.0
these batteries are the worst of any ive ever bought they have corroded inside of toys remotes noise cancelling range headphones and an expensive gun scope that i own ive tried aa and aaa and even gave them multiple chances the batteries in some electronic devices die within hrs so needless to say i have switched back to standard duracell batteries if you care about life and not having to mess with corrosion do not buy these batteries,1.0
it responds better to my husbands voice than mine but its been helpful and very easy to use,4.0
received as a christmas gift and it has met all of my expectations,5.0
easy to use and lots of handy features downside is the ads that apparently cant be shut off and you cant upload and and play downloaded youtube videos unless you are online,3.0
it states that the batteries last a while but i use them for my tv remotes and i ended up buying energizer a few days later they do not last i changed batteries twice the day i got them in mailthe triple a were no better,1.0
its nice but there are too many specific lines to remember to get her to talk to you also your family gmail calendar does not connect if on icloud with iphones so she will not know your families calendar needs updates and she should be able to answer you by a question and not a specific way you must say things with the skills,3.0
this fit my criteria of a low cost tablet that works well,4.0
these batteries work for normal things but when i tried to use them for a dog collar that is supposed to help with barking they were too weak and had to be changed after three uses annoying,2.0
i used these to replace the batteries in my digital safe a week or two later i needed to access something from the safe but it wouldnt open i was sure i was entering the right code but the safe just beeped and didnt unlock i didnt suspect the batteries right away because they were still almost new but eventually i plugged in a different brand and thats all it took the get the safe to work properly again it was a big relief and interesting to find out that aa batteries arent all created equal,1.0
they dont last as long as the higher end rechargeable do or the regular batts do i would say about half the time,2.0
i would recommend this to anyone it quite compact and easy to use and it good for any age,3.0
this tablet could be so much better if the apps actually worked decently the built in amazon pieces for prime members is great and work flawlessly but its not enough to overcome the terrible app behavior and countless freezes  they need to take a lesson or two from apple,2.0
great soundeasy to connectproblem is its not voice activatedso u have to push the wake button anytime u need to use itthat means it has b close at hand,3.0
i bought  fires for older friends  years old they run jw library app on it it has never given them any problems i used the tablets before i gave them to my friends and they seemed reliable and plenty fast a nice simple tablet and the best price a good intro to a tablet,5.0
disappointed in my handheld microsoft wireless game controller these last about  week duracellenergizers last  weeks amazon needs to select a higher quality rebranded battery to sell as amazon prime amazon could dominate this market by simply selling close to these prices a  longer lasting battery than duracell dont put these in any emergency device like smoke detectors emergency flashlights and radios,1.0
i love my new echo i have it sync with my android and echo will add items to your calendar set alarms and even tell you a joke it keeps getting better and better,5.0
once connected to my wifi it would not connect to daughters wifi when i visited her the loading time for programs is really slow oh well what did i expect for only ,2.0
was unable to get to google docs on this one even though the sales person said we would be able to my granddaughter needed this for school  it did not allow you to get to google docs,2.0
this is great for reading books or doodling at work,3.0
they are bad batteries not long lasting at all,1.0

bought for my  year old son for christmas he likes the amazon fire and using frequentlyprimarily for playing games my husband has had one for several years and uses it every day,4.0
bought these for my    year olds so i wasnt expecting top of the line performance especially for  bucks pros good clarity easy to usecheapexpandable storage with sd cardconsslow down loadscheap camera as expectedno mic for voice recognition would have been great for the kids to google search,3.0
these batteries are junk some of the new once have no more power than the once they replaced if they are good they ware out very quickly i dont like to make negative reports but these are so bad,1.0
bought this for christmas  after about  months the battery began to fail to hold a charge while the first  months were good  as many of the reviews here laud this tablet  the  day warranty is disappointing from amazon when i did have a different amazon device fail within the warranty period their exchange was immediate and easy for a brand new device  so the only warranty issue is with the lengthid recommend it if you just want a cheap tablet to throw in your bag but otherwise its just average,3.0
good price with ugly design,1.0
i purchased this tablet because it was extremely cheap im not impressed with anything about it it is slow not at all user friendly and the advertising is so very annoying it is also almost totally useless as it does not support the few apps i use on a regular basis i will keep it only to access my amazon accounts,2.0
we buy a lot of batteries and was hoping we had a way to get them to us theseas as long as the dollar store batteries some items  weeks others  i will not buy again,1.0
i didnt know much about the device before buying other than the fun commercials i figured that it was internet connected and could do anything i asked it to i quickly learned this is not the case you arent able to just plug it in and expect it to know everything on the internet it seemed it didnt know know some basic questions it uses skills where are like phone aps you have to enable each skill in order to use it when you want to use a skill much like an ap you have to remember the specific skill and then include that in what you ask it to do it seems like it does home automation well and basic functions but it has a long way to go before its a know everything on the internet,3.0
great batteries and a great price finally i dont have to travel to ikea for affordable batteries,5.0
great product she uses it everyday super light and easy to navigate,5.0
excellent product and the price is exeptionalthe units in stock and grate for educational purpose,5.0

i was looking for a kindle whitepaper i saw online for  what a deal i ordered it on line and picked it up in the store i got it home and couldnt adjust the brightness after a lengthy time with online customer service i called customer service after  minuets with speaking to a female elmer fud that doesnt speak english well i figured i would just return it although it looks identical to the  model you can not adjust the brightness that would have been good information before i bought it,1.0
easy to setup battery lasts for as long as needed you can do all the basics that a higher end tablet does and is reasonably priced,4.0
great speaker but i really dont need the features i just need good sound and dont really use anything besides that,3.0
great speed and function for a small price does what i needed,5.0
echo was easy to set up speaker is not as good as the google home both the nest thermostat and the inseon hub seem to be working okay with the echo stars because i have not used all the functions yet,3.0
i use hundreds of aaas annually and despite the graphics in ad these are about the poorest performing with least longevity of any i have bought still have another  of these but will likely go thru those quickly,1.0
poor choice the product did not work after only one week it froze on me and i was unable to get it to go to the factory reset i would not recommend this product at this time i will call amazon back to ask for my money and a refund after going on line i see that this is a common problem a problem that they should solve,1.0
we got the firetv because a friend recommended it to us we were stick of our cable bill constantly going up and this was the best optio its a onetime purchase fee and you can download an app called kodi and you can watch live tv previously played shows and movie you can think of and even sports granted sometimes the quality isnt the best its free we were paying almost  for cable and internet and now i pay  for internet and nothing to stay up with my shows and sports best purchase i have made in a long time,5.0
only a good price when on sale i can buy the same amount at manards for  less not on sale,4.0
wasnt what i thought it would be not a good investment,2.0
its nice to be able to tell alexa what you need from wherever in the house and the echo takes care of it sports uodates news music etc all with your voice very convenient,4.0
out of the box was easy to setup and configure very user friendly and integrates in my home nicely,5.0
my four year is very tech savvy better than some adultsgreat for shaping her real world experiences,4.0
i love my new kindle the size is perfect it fits right in my purse easy to navigate and i love the touch screen i am able to read outside without a glare only flaw is that it is not backlit so in order to read in the dark i need a book light i dont mind that so much i just wish kindle would come out with a case for this kindle with a built in book light like they did for the first generation kindle,4.0
i waited to get this keyboard until i did a little bit of research and i think that made all the difference in the time it took me to do the research amazon had pushed out an update that fixed the bluetooth problem the keyboard had been having a lot of the onestar reviews are from people who bought the keyboard when this problem hadnt been solved yetthe keyboard itself has all the keys youd expect alphanumeric keys up down left and right keys and a few extra like keys for the volume and a home key that actually takes you to the carousel screen however there are a few curious omissions no page up or page down no delete key theres a backspace key but thats not the same thingthe keys are wellspaced and its not a problem touch typing on the keyboard its certainly not as spacious as a fullsized keyboard but its about the size of a keyboard on a smallish laptopthe one thing they could add that might make this keyboard close to perfect is a way to carry it its a perfect portable size but its not something i would want to store in a backpack i will probably keep the box it came in for travel purposes,4.0
overall i think the kindle fire hd is a great product no complaint so far,4.0
easy hook up i keep it in the family area the grandkids ask alexa questions and play songs fun for everyone,4.0
i am looking forward to getting one for myself the person i got this for for swore up and down he dint want a tablet or need one now he loves it even for reading i thought he would never give up paperbacks,5.0
great alternative to cable easy to use and set up,4.0
the two guard stops at the bottom are way too high they dig into my wrists are are painful after only  minuteseverything else about the stand is excellent for a  laptop itll only work if you use an extended keyboardimpossible to type directly on the laptop bc of poor design the guards just need to be brought down and  their size and this would be perfect,2.0
works but has a tendency to freeze or get slow probably wouldnt purchase again,3.0
my wife and i wanted our children to still enjoy the feeling of having an ipad so we got the amazon fire kids edition it has been awesome i love the way you can set limits on the tablet so theyre not glued to it all day long kids mode is extremely beneficial,5.0

a nice upgrade from my original amazon tv firethe voice command feature has been flawlessa great purchase,5.0
i like the reader nice and small what i dont like is if you have a very secure wifi system at home it does not let you set it up i had to go to my daughters house and set it up that is a bit alarming it should be more secure since the only way we can put items on there is by putting our information on it that can be compromised make it more secure and easy to put protection on it that is the only reason i didnt make it a  star product,3.0
this product works but works slow compared to apple and some android phonestablets like i stated in my summary you pay for what you get no major issues thus far,3.0

nice price drop to  admittedly a device that makes your prime membership much more sticky but love accessing prime music through it,4.0
this is a great pad device big and good display just you have to familiar with the amazon os and they build it for ebook so it will a little bit slow for even web site surfingmore serious in game playing,3.0

novelty products ala siri provides information on the spot make sure that a wireless high speed internet connection is available or it will generate a great degree of frustration,4.0

unfortunately ive been using a far superior tablet when i decided to purchase the amazon fire tablet comparisons are unavoidable the amazon fire works amazon only apps are not as numerous as google the tablet is not as streamlined as my other tablet,2.0
this is a very simple unit to unit reading if not strenuous at all on the eyes,4.0
i am a die hard duracell and energizer user for many years truth is these are good for normal use items such as a tv remote or other items that arent on a constant drain however for long term uses on a day to day i still will stick with duracell but these are ok,3.0
my son loves this thing hasnt put it down yet keeps him entertained,5.0

love the battery life the ability to read in sunlight,5.0
i like the product but i dislike that you have to download every app i believe it should come with at least a few basic apps,3.0
i absolutely love this tablet i check my email i watch movies the only thing i do not like about the tablet is that it sometimes have problems taking you to the correct site but you must remember that it is a tablet not an computer i find all in all the picture is clear and the sound is wonderful also it has unlimited cloud storage which is good and when you download a picture it takes just a few minutes amazon prime is a must however or you will be spending a lot of money to view movies and read books as almost everything available cost money prime is a money saver and it lasts a full year it also comes with free shipping i tried it and it is good i receive my purchases in  days prime is the way to go if you purchase this tablet because it comes with a lot of perks,5.0
i bought this for my two year old grandson but the restrictions were too much,3.0
we bought this tablet for my son for christmas its a decent tablet for a kid and the price is reasonable i would recommend it for a person whos not big on technology its definitely not an ipad,3.0
these batteries lasted barely  weeks in a low drain device they actually performed worse than dollar store batteries i cant believe there are so many positive reviews maybe i got a bad batch luckily amazon is really good about giving refunds so this is more a warning about not wasting your time on these,1.0
tested and performed as good or better than the leading brands i have many amazon basic products from micro usb chargers to hdmi cables and all are excellent quality you would be crazy not to buy these amazon for president,5.0
i ordered these thinking they were rechargeable i recognize the error on my part but that is not my complaint here  so when i received them and used them i was not surprised that they died very quickly upon attempting to recharge these i figured out they arent rechargeable once again big duh on my partnow im seriously surprised that im only getting a few hours of use out of them like a quarter of the use that a typical battery should offer horribly disappointed i will go back to the name brand batteries for sure,1.0
go with a brand name,2.0

love firetvs and firesticks they always work well,5.0
nice upgrade from the original fire crisp resolution and easy to use,5.0
this is a nice little tablet for the  i paid on black friday at the regular price i would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much amazon content the lock screen ads arent much of a problem i understand amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads but the  amazon apps are a little much it would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you dont that said i was able to install the google play store and this tablet does everything i need it to do overall im pretty happy with the purchase its a nice new toy one note in the online photos the magenta looks purple its actually pink if you like purple get a black one and a purple case,4.0

i have to say this tablet is perfect for my young kids and durable,5.0
not a high performance battery its good for timer lights but not for regular usage will not order these again,2.0

i really like the features the size and the price but i was a bit disappointed with the lack of speed,3.0

both of my kids love this tablet the option to set it up for the kids is great my  year old likes to play in parent mode conpaired to the kids side cause there are not a lot of options for him very good product would buy again,4.0
thats crap,1.0
amazon fire is a good tablet if you like ebooks its also nice to get a sixmonth subscription to the washington post their claim to have  gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you  and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage  another problem is that you cant flag something as being inappropriate like you can on samsung galaxy tablets,2.0
excellent tablet for everyday browsing and use and a true bargain at the black friday price,5.0
unbelievable price purchased two one for myself and gift for grandchild shipped and arrived with  days,5.0

i purchased two of these tablets to replace all the other brands that stopped working within a two month period so far so good its a perfect fit for my two younger children and i feel you cant beat the price for a fire i have control on what they access the only downfall is the micro usb socket within the unit is loose when charging i have to fiddle with the plug to ensure it stays in the unit,4.0
i ordered my fire hd like a week before christmas the day i received it i ordered a case for it on amazon and before i even got the case it fell fro about  ft off the floor on carpet and the screen cracked i called bestbuy and i was told that i had free  months protection on it so i made an appointment with geek squad my husband called out of work to take me and when we go they tell me that i dont have any protrvtion plan and that there isnt anything they can do for me honestly it got to me because i you cant do anything about it its fine just tell me but dont male me gp allthe way there and waste my time ended up buying a better and bigger tablet although my amazon fire still works its screen is all cracked oh well,3.0
when i first got it was great until it stopped charging and wouldnt turn back on,1.0

this  inch fire is definitely better than the cheaper  inch it works fine enough for teens to play games and watch movies,4.0
i give these tablets away for prizes in our redemption store always sell out and a great value,4.0
in my search for a wireless speaker i looked at various models and decided on this one because of the portability the look and how it synced with alexa i have an alexa and this product was spot on the sound is great i use it in the balcony and stream all music from pandora different stations and the quality is great definitely would recommend,5.0

httpswwwamazoncomdpbjgvbgrefcmcrrypprdttlsol,5.0
seem to last a long time,4.0
its still confusing trying to figure out how to use alexa and the app to me alexa does not answer many questions at all or she does not understand many questions at all but i just need really be able to sit down and play around with the app is real funny though,4.0
several batteries dont work,2.0
doesnt hold the strength of duracell etc,3.0
i bought the batteries because of good reviews i checked the voltage on several of the batteries and they were fine i have not had the batteries in use long enough to comment further,3.0
its an okay product it is geared towards amazon users doesnt have apps that roku or apple tv have i got it for the direct now and it froze every time i used it,3.0
not as fancy as the ipad but a fraction of the cost works well with android system and all apps like on our android phones cant beat the price,4.0
i eventually had to return it because of the shades of yellow in the backlight when using it at night it was okay at day time but at night during which i usually read it was not what i expected to be premium cost product especially it was very annoying to read in the landscape mode i guess amazon needs a better qa department,1.0
bought for my kids and very easy to use and made homework easier,3.0
its great the price is right you can load lots of books and cloud is unlimited to keep your books,3.0
it was just the worst software ive ever seen you could barely play or do anything,1.0
needs to be more simpler parental contorl still need to be better,3.0
ideal for reading books just like a hard cover book,4.0
i received this as a christmas gift i was excited about this new product and downloaded the alexa app i am not an amazon prime member and i did not joined the free trial i asked questions to my alexa and it usually did not provide any answers or couldnt understand my questions despite giving simple commands the device looks good and the led light on top that turns on when you speak to it is great sound is good for music however i did not feel that it was a good assistant i did not like that you have to download skills to make alexa have more function you always had to speak alexa and then ask the skill you downloaded it then gets to a point that you dont even remember what skills you downloaded so you always had to look at your phone or mobile device to see what you had i exchanged it for the google home and it has been a better device it plays music from google music and not only music that you have purchased it answer a lot of questions and gives you great news briefing instead of downloading the particular skills it also provides more answers to questions and i was surprise by the detail of the answer at time i highly recommend to google home device i have not tested it with chromecast smart tv or with smart home appliances such as nest etc,2.0
got these mainly for use in xbox one controllers they dont last quite as long as energizer lithium id say maybe  as long but for the quantity and price its a good deal will continue to use,4.0
all the batteries came dead so i did a return and got new ones second order was the same as the firstupdate still have yet to receive refund from second order after several weeks,1.0
i thought there would be a bigger step up from the fire stick honestly if you want to save money just go with the fire stick,3.0
i recently purchased this amazon fire for my daughter i like that it has the little accent of a night light so if we are watching a movie in the dark she can still use it without illuminating the entire room features are average just like any other tablet it is a little bulky but for a child it gets the job done pretty sturdy when its dropped doesnt have much storage but the good news is you can add your own sd to create more storage,3.0
not as smart as the commercials show cant answer a lot of questions,3.0
i love how this one lets you download apps the picture quality is also a  i do find myself having to unplug it every  days to make it start over or it has trouble downloading especially with live tv apps as for its competitors id say this is still the one to get i find myself having a lot more options with this one so my cons are minor but still prevented me from a  star rating i believe their next generation will be a  tho like i said its still the one with the most options available especially if you have prime the best thing about fire tv is it lets me download the direct tv app so i ditched my cable and just play live tv thru the app its the same tv and i pay over a  less a month now its worth it just for that,4.0
these batteries dont last even in a simple digital clock  weeks at best,1.0
slow to use because there are constant popups barely dropped it  feet to the ground and now it doesnt work highly unsatisfied,2.0
love my alexa so much best gadget ever very accurate cant get enough of alexa love it so much i got the dot as well,5.0
whether youre a bookworm or a casual reader the kindle paperwhite is a great way to read and discover new and interesting books admittedly i only read infrequently since purchasing my kindle i absolutely love the size and abilities of the kindle and have been reading  books per month since purchasing it highly recommended,5.0
able to surf the net and facebook but slow in those apps and you get all notifications that occurred since the last time you were on your kindle even if you checked your facebook notifications prior to using the kindle excellent for its purpose of reading only which is why i bought it,5.0
very fun and informational tool to have bought this for my wife but everyone loves it,5.0
i loved this tablet i did but i did not love that i was being sold ads every time i powered up i loathe even more that i would have had to pay  to discontinue that feature amazon if you want  dollars for the kindle fire charge it but dont under price the device and then flash ads at the the consumer at every opportunity it is unbecoming of you i returned this item pronto,2.0
i like alexa but limited cant connect with itunes account yet can only set a one time alarm with  hours and cannot make it recurring i see improvements weekly but still a long way to go,3.0

this certainly isnt the most impressive device out there but at  it is a fantastic value,3.0
this device is user friendly it is easily transported there are many wonderful apps to choose from the price is fabulousa great gift for santa to bring,4.0
the product works well however you have to hold down the button to use the best part of the device alexa i really wanted to take it back because it can be a little annoying to hold down the button every time you have a question but the sound quality of this product is just so dog on awesome,3.0
this product is great for reading you the news a book or the weather alexa is great at setting timers and alarms and telling silly jokes if you ask alexa a google type question such as what was the score to such and such college basketball game most times she cannot answer even if you pose the question a number of ways sometimes you can ask a question differently from the way you would intuitively ask a question and alexa will answer this proves frustrating to me it is a very expensive gadget that your phone can easily do with a few keystrokes i am considering returning it and purchasing the google product to see if there is an improvement,3.0
easy to install easy set up would recommend to friends,4.0
pretty tangerine color first tablet had bad earphone jack second product would not connect to wifi no matter where we tried all of our other tablets work finewe will order another amazon fire tablet,1.0
im returning it because a new version is coming i,1.0
since this is an android  based tablet i sideloaded a few necessary apps to allow it to be used essentially the same as an android tablet with google play store etc the screen resolution speaker ram are just only adequate otherwise a good cheap tablet really need to ponder its utility before buying it,3.0
i was a long time apple tv user but recently cut ties with the cable company and got sling and didnt want to shell out more for another apple tv i have had my fire tv for a few weeks now and love it i havent really used the voice controls that often but it works great i would definitely recommend it especially if you are using kodi,5.0

these batteries are just fine and does the job would recommend,4.0
firesticks are cheap but getting the fire tv meant less buffer time and less lag before watching my shows,5.0
its fast connects well every amazon aspect of life you could possibly want is on here thats what i didnt expect it being my first tablet amazon gets in your face about all its promos and products every time i turn it on its so annoying but its very handy very sleek easy to use and connects quick to any wifi acess around however its limited on games and its app store is crap compared to android so ehhh ,3.0
ive had amazon tablets in the past and this is the far worst ive bought it was slow drained the battery kicking me out of the apps all the time,1.0
decent but have to reset monthly i have to unplug and at times re enter my pass cause this freezes or stops completely you can add kodi though i would still but one for living rm though,4.0
this is my second tablet and its a great starter tablet if you have a prime account its even better the prime video allows you to download videos for later viewing,5.0
i had to replace my original kindle and decided to buy the kindle fire the fire has so many more abilities than my old kindle but it is difficult to read in direct sunlight,4.0
fast almost no buffering overall a great product but only complaint is its seriously slanted toward amazon prime for instance i have amc through a cable subscription then why do i need to pay again for episodes on the amazon amc app so stupid with roku i dont need to pay anything extra for episodes im already entitled to,3.0

love how covenant and quick it is easy to use and universal,5.0
i was initially excited to get the kindle i am extremely disappointed with all the ads even more disappointed to find out that i could pay amazon more money to remove the ads its frustrating that best buy and more specifically amazon dont let the consumer know on the box or in store advertising that what youre buying is a mini advertising billboard why couldnt there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the low price is subsidized by all the ads on the device would this have changed my purchase absolutely i would have spent a couple bucks more and probably got a samsung tablet,2.0
great tablet for a beginner tablet being used by older,4.0
got an echo for the house and love its functionality easy set up and easy to use looking to purchase a couple of dots for other areas in the house,4.0
this is just a regular fire tablet that has protective case,1.0
so far we are very much enjoying the product great for outdoor use by the pool due to its portability we have not had a chance to really test how long it can go without a charge but a couple hours has been no problem only catch is that you cannot stream a single spotify account on more than one device at the same time so if you find yourself purchasing the dot or echo you will not be able to stream using the same account at the same time,4.0
the tablet is not incredibly easy to use and to load stuff onto,5.0
very nice size now only  theres no google play store so cant use google chrome cast to watch movies on tv a tablet without a google play store is a disadvantage,2.0
a good starter tablet but very very slow dont expect and i pad savy child to enjoy this but for a true beginner it would be fine,3.0
i bought several of these tablets for my grandchildren they love it,4.0
i was excited about purchasing the amazon echo but when i received it after about  weeks i had to return it because a lot of times alexa did not hear me or understand what i asked,3.0
they work but i wish they were usa made,3.0
the amazon warranty of this product is great for a reason it needs to be because they have to keep replacing it i had two that died within weeks and every single one has broken the screen,3.0

i like the paperwhite as it was very easy to read while sitting on the beach in bright sunlight,5.0
the battery life is much poorer compared to name brands like energizer and duracell,1.0
nice amazon fire tablet butthe camera is not clear enough  megapixels and amazon fire is very slow wedsite and app it takes very forever download i think i have to returned on best buy and buy a good tablet  lenovo and samsung galaxyi will gave a zero rating star,1.0
i am reading positive reviews and wish i could say the same best buy is great so this is not a reflection on them just our experience with the product we have had this product for just over one month and i have had to contact amazon support perform factory resets to get content to show up and the device is poorly designed as the sd card pops out constantly which messes with drm and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the internet to fix it we are returning and spending the extra money for an ipad will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience if you just use the device for reading maybe this is for you but trying to download information to sd card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating as well as having to do factory resets so content owned already purchased on amazon would show up on the device in the library,1.0
the price was great for these batteries but they dont last for very long for some items they dont work at all its like they just dont have a lot of power i will not be getting these again,3.0
great price for longlasting batteries they also come packaged in a very convenient cardboard box that makes it easy to remove just as many batteries as you need,5.0
excellent device very fast especially when connected to ethernet,5.0

led to more echo dots and significant home automation,5.0
wondering why i spent  for the echo when i could have purchased the dot for  and does everything the echo doesand more with the dot you can stream music to bluetooth speakers which cant be done with the echo,3.0
was more expensive than other batteries on amazon and the name brands are definitely better either buy these in bulk for a discount or go with the name brands for the same price,4.0
if you are getting this get it on a saleit slow and choppy but its decent for light media consumption and browsing,3.0
i used them for my xbox  controllers they do not last long compared to name brands,1.0
i originally purchased the google home as a gift for my husband he quickly was frustrated with google home as it didnt respond to what he was as asking the echo is much better equipped to answer questions and follow commands than its competitors,4.0
bought as a gift for mom ive seen one before nothing spectacular but they work fixed a screen for a friends last year it took maybe  minutes so thats a plus,3.0
i got it to store all my college books without checking to see if they would even be compatible they werent its my fault for not checking this the three star rating is because you can buy a good tablet for less and use the kindle app which is what i did i can now read my books and have a fully functional tablet,3.0
the paperwhite provides backlighting so that it can be read in dark environments it still has the same long battery life as the original the software is pretty much the same i gave up the whispernet capability in upgrading but havent missed it much since i always have plenty of unread material already downloaded over wifi,5.0

there have been a few minor changes included in this new kindle that i dont particularly likeopening page is slightly confusing,3.0
i like the amazon echo but it needs more improvements it does not understand many things you ask it does not connect to all my wemo devices however it is good at what it does the sound quality is the best it offers i like the local weather and  day weather and news with my amazon prime my music is played and sounds great some might say it is too high a price to pay however i bought it for  barely used and glad i purchased it,4.0

i went through these like water  stick with duracell or energizer,2.0
i felt the system mived extremely slow not good for streaming great reader,2.0
initially i bought this for my son and hes been using it everyday with a protective cover since my purchase my only issue i have really with the unit is that the charging port is in a horrible position and its very difficult to insert the charger easily i may have a defective unit which i may have to return since the charging port is quite loose the price was right but quality could be a little better,3.0

a day or two after these batteries arrived i installed several of them in toys and our small keyboard which also has ac power the next morning my son called me into the living room mom theres chocolate sauce all over the piano and the table it wasnt chocolate sauce it was battery acid as he said good thing i didnt taste itfor what its worth the keyboard was plugged in and it had not been turned on or played since the batteries were installed the five new batteries were in place for about  hours before the leak was discoveredthe green seal fell off of two of the five batteries as i removed them from the compartment the acid left a  stain on my tablethe other batteries that i installed that day still seem to be okay although ive developed a paranoia about checking them i have used amazon batteries in the past with no problems which is why im giving  stars instead of  the attached photo shows the rings that fell off i wish id taken a photo of the puddle they left on the keyboard and table but i was too focused on cleanup to stop and take a pictureyoull also note that these batteries are darker in color than the product image that is currently shown they came this way and ill use that difference to keep an eye on their performancedurability,2.0

the three star review is for the situation described here not the quality of the unit i ordered this online and picked it up in store the package was very securely sealed the seals appeared to be factory the echo was wrapped in plastic and looked like it had never been out of the package when i hooked it up however it said that the unit was registered to someone else it wasnt a problem to get it registered to me and the unit works fine i spoke to both amazon and target about this and neither could tell me what happened i was offered an exchange if i wished i chose to keep the original unit but i wanted to make others aware of the issue i have one theory target has a buyer who purchased a lot of these for target resale and they are all registered to this person i guess ill never know the echo itself works fine and im very happy with it after you hook it up make sure to go to settings and download the latest updates then you should be good to go,3.0

i was pleasantly surprised that i have enjoyed the kindle fire this was my first ever use of buying books on kindle due to summer courses i was taking at the time in mayjune  what i liked kindle books synched on macbook and fire tablet very helpful when it came time to write my papers the highlights i made while i read the book on the tablet synched to the version i read on the macbook desktop this helped a ton especially with things like formatting the footnotes watching videos cool little feature while you watch a video you can tap the screen and it will list the actors who are currently one the screen  amazon shopping i can now understand peoples amazon shopping addictionsl i will give it to amazon this tablet became my gateway to using prime and countless hours of online browsing prior to this i rarely purchase items online i can see how they have made it so easy across platforms  portability i like that i will bring this with me for my general online browsing and reading needs rather than having to use my laptop or my phone what i did not like signon screen adsthere is no way to turn them off i suppose for  depending if you purchased on a sale the advertisers are subsidizing the cost of the tablet however i wished this was stated as a feature before purchasing it i may have paid the money and upgraded to the next kindle if i had known it could not be turned off  turning offstandby mode this took some time to get used to rather than an issue when you turn the tablet off it is really on a standby mode so the batteries will drain you have to hold the button a little longer and make sure it is turned off  weather app i dont know if this is just my tablet the weather app does not update as soon as you open it it takes minutes if at all to update with the current weather i have not been able to find in any forums if other people are experiencing the same issue i have instead downloaded and used other weather apps but at this point the app is worthless  screen resolution its not the best but i got used to it for reading and occasional video viewing purposes it is sufficient  screen dimmerblue light mode i read and use the tablet at night and have gotten sensitive to the brightness of the tablet screen and the systems default dimmer and blue light feature is awful the blue light app allows you to set the color tone however it is so orange it makes it unreadable the app i use instead is called bluelight blocking and even dimming the brightness with the slider was still too bright for me so i have had to download the app dimly so be able to set the brightness,4.0
i usually buy the   battery special at harbor freight but they were not on sale when i needed some so i decided to get theseboth of the batteries are supposed to be alkaline so you would think they would both last about the same length of time no soi use these in a personal pedi callused skin grinder so they get a good workoutamazons batteries just dont last as long and its a noticeable differenceim going back to harbor freights alkalines,2.0

i purchased three of these tablets as christmas gifts for my kids it was a great deal since best buy had them on sale for ea they were very excited to get their own tablet the  inch is a bit small for my taste however great for kids the amazon service that provides ample apps for kids is a great deal since you can add up to four kids on one account,4.0
we already have an echo so i didnt think we needed the tap and procrastinated getting it now we use it everyday  mostly to stream amazon prime tunein or pandora channelsit is funny how the latest technology sometimes brings us back to where we were when i was a kid  having a beat box to carry around room to room and outside we use the tap as a  version of a beat box that is much smaller rechargeable and way easier to tune and with side benefits of controlling our lights hvac and with alexa onboard ready to answer the random trivia questionsthe sound quality could be a bit better but surprisingly good adjusting the volume isnt as easy as it should be the battery lasts a long time and its a snap to use a bluetooth speaker as well,5.0
this is a neat product but did not fit my needsi have several bluetooth devices and some could not be recognized so i did return it might be good for others as what did work worked ok,3.0

these run down in my tv remote quicker than any battery i have used tv says low battery within a week of installing i will try another brand next time amazon please keep an eye on quality and have your manufacturer test and give you results periodically they will often provide good samples for evaluation early in production and then lower quality later,1.0

this is a competent tablet at a bargain price unfortunately it is crippled by a useless operating system amazons take on android essentially removes all functionality that makes android great to force you to use their services and apps instead of googlesif youre a tinkerer or dont mind doing some software hacking this is a pretty easy fix you can hack googles apps and services back into it resulting in an amazing and amazingly cheap android tabletunless youre willing to do or hire someone to do those software modifications youll probably be disappointed if you are itll be the best cheap tablet youll ever ownit looks like it might be great for kids even in its stock state i dont have kids so i could not test that but i added a star for that possibilityunmodified  starsmodified  stars,3.0

this tablet screen and memory is lackluster at best but other than that if you are replacing another one of the kids tablets or giving a gift to an older family member this is the way to go the video on amazon website shows a better picture while streaming video amazon one touch is turned on automatically so be careful to password protect purchases unless you dont mind a lot of  purchases in short they make it too easy to purchase items by mistake i thought i was on prime video and notice that i was charged for an episode of warehouse  since i didnt see the show and caught this quickly i was able to chat with amazon customer care and they walked me through how to change that setting online this tablet not for me since im looking for a higher end media tablet with more memory than the gb this unit has,3.0

theyre batteries theyre cheaper than walmart what more could you want i dont have stats on whether they last longer than duracell or energizer but at this price i dont think it really matters the brand amazon basics has tons of useful stuff all the way from batteries to laptop bags and more it seems like amazon wasnt enough of a household name so theyre trying to make it so everything in your house has the amazon name on it but i aint mad let them take over i just wish they had an amazon basics brand for disposable diapers,4.0

i really liked the idea of having a device i could talk to out of nowhere that would answer although our cells phones can do similarly but you have to turn them on and press buttons etc it is also gratifying to be able to tell a device to play music and it does i was quite disappointed in the ability of alexa to answer any serious questions jeff needs to pay to send his programmers back to search school so many times alexa says a phrase similar to i dont understand the question so basically i paid for a radio i paid extra for the larger one but the output is still no different than a clock radio come on amazon,2.0

its a nice looking cover will keep the fire clean but not particularly safe in a fall i have the black one it is very professional looking no padding whatsoever it does wake the fire up when opened and shut down when closed but that has never been important to me my problem with all of the cases is that you have to hold the cover out in order to keep the camera clear and it makes clicking the shutter a little awkward id like to see an opening on the front cover that matches up to the opening on the back so you can have it folded in half and still be able to view the subject,3.0
just wat i wanted,5.0

the amazon fire tv box hooks to cable modem easily and is very userfriendly great for amazon prime members the only issue is that there is not enough k content out there and in my opinion does not warrant the price as opposed to the more portable amazon fire tv stick yes the box has a faster processor and more ram than the stick but for content ive had no problem with the stick and its cheaper,4.0
the fire  has a great price you get your moneys worth however you may have to do an exchange if you get a damaged one the one i bought had a busted pixel in the screen there was no damage to the case or glass screen but the image had a bright white puncture hole in the screens image ive owned multiple but i have never had this problem before with an epad tablet when i just bought it i will now have to visit best buy again tomorrow for an exchange im hoping theyre still in stock its not best buys fault the fault lies with amazon theyre clearly not that durable,2.0

we searched for months wanting to cut our cable bill bought the amazon fire tv box amazon has their own programming and is adding more all the time also downloaded a bunch of apps and have been watching ted talks nonstop also bought an hd antenna for local channels of which we get about  deprogrammed the foreign language shopping preachers and still left with about  which offer the  main broadcasters and a lot of ss repeats,4.0

i bought the kindle fire not to long ago but wasnt happy with it because of the glare and lack of a backloght which hurt my eyes i was hesitant to but another kindle but im glad i did this is exactly what i needed to replace the fire its a little small but so much better than what i had before,5.0
i will never purchase this item again it is in my opinion overpriced junk,1.0

the last  models of kindle hdx  have been terrible we have purchased  of each model of kindle and up until the last  models they have been great last years had to be replaced  or  times and for the same problem the slot for the sd card is defective i gave up and bought the newest model it shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason its going back after the first of the year this is going to be my last year for kindles unless they make them the same quality as before phooey,1.0
this is definitely not an ipad or a high end tablet nevertheless for the discounted price that i paid on it so less than  it is well worth getting i wanted something bigger while waiting for the next ipad air to come out and this fits the bill for paying little and getting a basic low end tablet it is geared towards amazon media consumption ad it does that decently even with a screen resolution less than hd if the sale comes back again where it is  off i would not hesitate to recommend it again,3.0
great product but needs to learn more it would be nice if it could connect to tv sound,4.0

good for setting alarm reading look up easy stuffs overall makes like convenient,4.0
started leaking shortly after reciept,2.0
pros  a beefy machine for the price great battery management in standby a solidly built android tab at a rock bottom price cons proprietory amazon user interface may be irritating but this is a personal preference the app selection is limiting but you can install google play and get all you need from there  brightness and resolution may not be the greatest but completely usable  a compromise for the low price had some wifi issues on several occasions compatibility issues it is a little weak also may be a bit small and aspect ratio is a bit weird long an narrowoverall a reasonable tab that does the job done not many games though for a minimal investment,4.0
great product for our little ones they both recieved this for christmas and love it,5.0
these batteries work extremely well and i have proved this by field testing them in my girlfriends torpedo big john toys last a long time have not experienced any moisture induced corrosion ytd,5.0

i have had every version of the kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a kindle fire i replaced the first one i had in  and it was everything i wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat soi got this one first of all i miss swype why get rid of it secondly i cannot put two of my favorite apps which work on my old one to work on this but lastly and most importantly every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code shimmering in the background and only turning it off andor leaving it for awhile brings it back to life and it turns itself off it seems to happen when i close a program and move to a new one aggravating and not what i expect from a product with which i have been happy in the past,3.0
i got this for my daughters for christmas this is a great gift it helps them learn and keep them out of trouble thanks again best buy,4.0

very fun and useful product that can only get better with time kind of similar to siri or google assistant on steroids but has the potential to be so much better,4.0

excellent product and makes reading books very easy very light and allows you to have access to numerous books on the go the epaper display makes reading really enjoyable and does not suffer from glare and the harsh back light from the displays on phones and tablets,4.0
i liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky also you can it use all android apps the worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight it was fully charged i have tried recharging and turning on etc it is just a blank screen and off kind of a cool paperweight hope i can get my money back or get a new one,1.0

it was ancient technology and did not keep up with the internet,1.0
this is a basic tab i bought this for my sister you cant really do anything much on this unless you have an amazon account and you have to buy a prime membership which is expensive but i was still able to use it for games and internet browsing i had difficulty using it for anything more camera was not the best,3.0
works as described happy with the purchasegot another one for the room ,5.0
let me set the stage for this review i joined a book club this year and have started reading a lot or at least what i would consider to be a lot which is about  decentlylong books a monthup until buying the paperwhite i was doing most of my reading on my iphone using the kindle app long story short i ended up returning the paperwhite after about  weeks why because i realized just how sporadic my reading was i read when im out and about waiting at a doctors office or inline at a restaurant etc it became overwhelmingly apparent to me that the best ereader is the one you have with you at all times for me thats my iphonethe actual reading experience is definitely better on the paperwhite however if youre an onthego reader like me then it just means you have to carry around another device dedicated ereaders are for people who either truly read a ton or have a set routine for reading if thats not you then stick with your phone,3.0
these die out super quickly in saying that im not sure if the items they were in sucked the life out of the faster but they still died used nearly a whole pack for little led closet lights in a couple of months  only on for a few minutes at s time,2.0
worst battery i have ever came across dont use for childrens toys leaks battery acid had in my daughters mobile and the batteries only lasted  days when any other battery lasts a month and when i replaced them this morning i found they leaked battery acid all over,1.0

this tablet is a great tablet for the average user it has decent sound quality and works great as a reader,4.0
love the tablet mainly use for games and internet grrat product foe the price,4.0
wish the kindle fire for kids had better way to limit how many items you can download at once most kids do not understand that clicking on a bunch of pictures will download that gameprogram which is clog download times needs a better way to remove unwanted items rather than clicking and clicking on every item speed and performance is pretty good for a tablet app store is great and has many items,4.0
made in the usa would make this a  star,3.0
permanent offers of games are a nuisance but the reading experience is very good,4.0
they are great come in minimal packaging and work as well as or better than brand name,5.0
good price but i cant tell if these last as long as duracell amazonbasics with amazon prime are a great deal though and id probably buy them again i havent had any problems with corrosion or other concerns,3.0
high quality batteries at a great price they are comparable to duracell and come in a box with packs of four,5.0
these batteries do not come close to duracel in terms of longevity,1.0
hard to connect to the internet extremely slow to load apps not many free apps like apple the only thing i really like is the protection it offers,1.0

was looking for a lowpriced tablet to access my kindle and magazine apps  specifically the economist what i didnt realize was that this was the adversion of the kindle so removing ads on it would not be possible wo fee  and worse theres some limitation around some apps and everything located in the google play store so apps like the economist were not available sooooo returned,2.0
i was expecting an android device and discovered it was an android like device my fault for not reading up on his device before hand i returned the amazon fire and bought a samsung tab ei probably would recommend this tablet if you wanted a device for reading,3.0
the reason people give it  stars is because they dont give the product enough time before they review it i purchased this along with my kindle dx on august   i can honestly say that i dont recommend this product as it will damage the kindle the hinge that attaches to the kindle will eventually put pressure on the kindle front plastic cover and soon you will see it crack to avoid this you have to make sure the kindle doesnt rock back and forth from off the back cover causing the hinge to bend more and crack the front plastic further this is hard to do if you open and close your kindle many times a day or simply lend it to someone else who doesnt know better one thing i can honestly say is that i really wanted to like this product i really wanted it to work im looking for a slip cover now,1.0
good job amazon great product easy to hook up and start watching movies sports etc,4.0
lol the only reason i bought this tablet was so i could load my games from my phone and play them on larger screen but i didnt realize that sonce its an amazon product it wont load google play or support vlash of clans or any other google game a big thumbs down i guess im just stuck with a tablet that is useless for me,1.0
i just prefer live tv when you purchase these dont forget to buy an antenna so you can watch network tv and local news,2.0
i purchased this item on the recommendation of many existing owners however when i got home and attempted to set up the device it was frustrating and the instructionsfaqs were not very helpful the echo could not find my nest thermostat nor could it find about half of my hue lights once i argued and fought with alexa for about  minutes she finally started to pick up my lights and after comletely reconfiguring my thermostat she could see it but she would not work with it once she found all of my lights she would turn them on or off but would not change colors or brightness levels i run a software company and have worked in and with computers my whole life this should not have been this quirky i would not recommend this item get a google home,1.0
upgraded my  year old kindle same old doesnt seem that great of a difference the graphical interface still sucks but its decent for reading,3.0

i bought this tablet for my  year old for his birthday because he chose it when we went shopping for a tablet he loves it and it is easy to use,4.0

the supplied amazon bluetooth remote control will not pair back with the main unit this is the second one i bought with the same issue repairing the remote is quite simple per the instructions but to no avail had to use a android remote with a usb dongle to operate the unit going through batteries like crazy trying to get it to pair back up no more than three inches from main unit,1.0
my only complaint is that gb is really not enough memory if you do audiobooks or videos,4.0
this is the third power charger that i have had to buy at cost of over  each since my kindle fire purchase why cant the chargers last a reasonable amount of time when i connected this charger i received a message saying that it was a low level charger it probably would not charge while the kindle was in use not acceptable for this cost,1.0
fire tv changed my life this unit is awesome i absolutely love it,5.0
they seem to have a very short life span do not think i would buy again,3.0
they went dead before even using them the ones i used lasted maybe hours at best ,1.0
a lot of apps are incomplete doesnt run apps that great and has a lot of apps that are generic,1.0
i have no idea why these batteries are reviewed so well i used them in a small led keyboard light for my computer and i had to change them weekly sure you get more batteries for less money but in total i think youd be better off buying a quality brand,1.0
easy to use but would like more apps to use with looking food to connect to home devises,4.0
the one purchased at best buy had black and gray lines appearing across the screen when powering up it got worse to occurring while using it amazon was contacted via chat and determined something was wrong and exchanged it the replacement from amazon is working so for this i will mark yes to recommend it,2.0
best purchase ever love our echo highly recommend the amazon echo to anyone,5.0
i bought this product from amazon about a month ago the reviews seemed great so i gave them a tryafter using the batteries in my xbox one controllers for about  weeks the controller began to malfunctionupon further inspection i checked the batteries and the compartment was a little bit wet so i cleaned it up and went to get new batteries still in the plastic wrapper and all of the batteries had an oily residue around them some type of leakage overall dont save money here as you might lose your equipment and the money you spend on the batteries,1.0

this is a great streaming device easy to use and user friendly it says it plays k which is a plus ive streamed amazon and ps vue on here and read that games can be played too i am a chrome cast user so am used to managing everything on my phone not a remote but the remote is nice and has voice control which is great i just wish the fire tv app would show what you see on screen so you can navigate from your phone instead of having it look like a mousepad it takes getting used to overall it is great addition to my streaming devices,4.0
these last about a week,3.0
fun for the first few days but we hardly use it now after figuring out it cant answer many of our queries,3.0
i bought this for my daughter for christmas they love it,5.0
this kindle is great for reading books which is exactly what its designed for very crisp text in bright daylight or complete darkness it feels good in your hands weight is balance it doesnt feel flimsy either quick page transitions when reading dont expect it to compete with tablets in the app or visuals departments because thats not what its meant to be used for gave it  stars instead of  because the touch screen tends to be a little picky at times,4.0
if you need to read a review about this product youve been living in a cave,5.0
the tips seem to be polished so much that they do not make good contact i had a problem where these batteries wouldnt work at all but the duracell ones that i took out would after swapping back and forth a few times i took them to my battery tester and found that i had to twist them around to get them to register so i took my batteries to some sand paper to get the contact point to work,2.0

these batteries do not last long at all as compared to energizer after  days of use they were no good anymore the energizer batteries have last me two weeks so far when using for the same thing i will be using far more batteries so it really isnt a money saver disappointed,2.0
i am extremely disappointed with these batteries which stems not from longevity or power but with fit almost immediately upon receiving them i installed them into three electric candles no joy i cleaned the contacts still no joy i tested the batteries full charge just for grins i installed into one candle three rayovac brand batteries and the candle lit with no problem removed the rayovacs installed the amazons and again no joy i repeated this a couple of times with the same results and i tried this in the other two candles with identical results all three candles lit with the rayovacs none with the amazons knowing the issue was not with candles i took a rayovac and lined it up with an amazon and discovered something interesting the batteries were just a wee bit differentthe length of the positive terminals are different just a tad longer on the rayovac see picture the rayovac terminal is taller longer while the amazon terminal is squattier and therefore shorter the difference in length is tiny no question but when youre putting batteries into a rather cheap device to start with that tiny bit of length in this case seems to be the difference between one battery forming a sufficient connection and the other one not ill keep the amazons to use in devices mice for example that are likely more solidly built than these candles and have a greater connection tolerance or a stronger spring to hold the battery firmly in place i am concluding that when replacing batteries in an older device that may not force as firm a connection or in a cheapo device that may not hold batteries tightly from the getgo use a brandedname batteryi am a longtime and extremely satisfied user of amazon basic computer cables among their first products in the basics line but was recently disappointed with another item i purchased outside of the computer connectors and cables line that being dog housetraining piddle pads which have not proven as absorbent as similarlypriced products and ive bought a lot of different brands the batteries were my second foray into basics product lines outside of the ohsodependablecables arena and now im  for  in the disappointed column i never thought there was a difference in batteries and now i know differently the next time i see a duracell commercial emphasizing reliability and dependability ill think back to this experience as i will when selecting batteries in the future i so wanted to like these amazon batteries too,2.0
mother needed something since her tablet had died was lot easier for her to learn than her old table she does lots more with kindle than she did with tablet,5.0

ehhthey run out of charge very quicklyits honestly bad for the environment they do seem to be a bargain but a brand name might come in a smaller quantity but will last longer than theseupdate  these batteries packs have  workingshort term and  nonworking batteriesi brought multiple battery packs and all have batteries that dont workin my estimation i think these batteries are not worth it,2.0
too much amazon not enough google but for  to surf the net is ok i guess,4.0
so far they are work well however have had them long enough to determine if how long they last compared to duracell batteries,3.0
dont last very long but good quality for the price,4.0
should have been included with the ereader,2.0
its a good tablet for the value downside is theres no google play store access so youre limited to apps in the amazon app store,3.0
got this for my living room for my kids to interact with they love asking alexa questions and the price was great for what it does also have a few dots and hoping to be able to join all speakers as one in the future,5.0
must have amazon paid service to play music from the cloud and must be set up from the mobile app not portable cannot connect to fire tv took some getting use to for me to get the commands right to change my nest thermostat must use the app to install rd party skills to the app to control smart devices,2.0
if you have hulu netflix amazon prime etc get this because you can control all of them from this device its awesome and faster than the fire stick and you can play games too gotta get the game controller totally worth it,5.0
since it is called powerfast i thought it is a fast charger but it is not fast at all it worked but it took about  hours to charge an almost empty kindle fire hd  inch tablet,3.0
inexpensive and decent quality battery for around the house,4.0
i bought three of these for my kids ages  to  and it works great for what they use them for my only wish is that it came with google play store but we were able to install that separately and works well,4.0
amazon fire is great for reading my kindle books checking email facebook or checking out the internet havent ckd out what else i can do with it but im sure there is a lot,5.0
the echo is a nice speaker that has the added bonus of being able to respond to questions and give sometimes useful information however in regards to it being capable of serving as the brain of an integrated automated home it lacks much i purchased it to use with philips hue bulbs and i was hoping my fire tv although it shares the same software with the fire and logically should be able to work together it does not echo will not connect to or control the tv as far as the philips hue bulbs it can turn on individual bulbs or even a group of bulbs if and only if you remember the exact phrase or name you gave it it cannot dim the lights set light scenes or any of the cooler options the philips hue bulbs are capable of i wound up going back to using my iphone which respond to voice command of hey siri better than the echo anyway if i had to do it over again i would have saved the money and gone with a simple bluetooth speaker for my phone as it can already do many of the things the echo does only difference is that the phone doesnt have as big of a range for voice pickupi did give the echo three stars because the one thing it does well is respond to questions like whats the weather like that feature is interesting but not worth paying nearly  for,3.0
while it isnt the most powerful tablet on the market it does what it was designed to do it gets on the social media sites and the internet if youre expecting more from yoru tablet then dont look for one at this price youll need the more powerful ones that translate to bigger price tags ive watched movies on this from my amazon prime account and have read my books from my kindle account and everything works well its not at lightening speed but it does get there in a timely manner,4.0
i love this kindle i love the fact that you can use an sd card for more storage great job,5.0
sorry amazon i love you but these batteries are terrible they dont last long at all reordered before i realized that they peter out in short order they have failed in every application requiring batteries unfortunately their made in indonesia wasnt putting them in the china slot immediately but have no choice to do so applications referred to are tooth brush remote controls motion lights etc purchased aaa aa with no difference in performance i enjoyed the idea of being stocked up on quantity but the quantity doesnt replace quality wont be ordering these batteries again but will be shopping for a superior productjmac,1.0

great music and fun to test her knowledge amazing how qickly she responds to any question cannot stump her,4.0
ive owned a fire stick chromecast apple tv and roku this is by far my favorite device for cutting cords,5.0
i am a believer of streaming tv especially with the cost of comcast bills continually going up i like the fact that i can watch what i want when i want when you look at what you pay comcast and at  t for tv it makes more sense to look into these amazon devices in which i have  now ive personally turned in all of my dvrs to comcast i went from  to  a month thats almost half i have the comcast package just above basic with internet blast also if you look on the internet youll find ways to get free channels with this device im saving money and have access to more things to watch now what more could you ask for,5.0

i cant believe ive wasted my money on cable all these years im really happy with my purchase,4.0
i bought this thing refurbished i find that i have to unplug  plug back in the hdmi cable on a regular basis when switching inputs on the tv not sure if it is the amazon fire box itself or if it is the tv not likelyotherwise it is a good device i bought it for the ability to hard wire my ethernet connection to my gigabit switch and for k capabilities which it does do having the alexa app is handy but her features can be severely handicappedi probably should have just bought it new usually refurbished devices work well as they are tested before resale and it was probably tough to catch that the hdmi port on these might be finicky i may have to switch it out,2.0
love the kindle products i bought the original kindle years ago so this is a nice upgrade,5.0
what a fun toy this is it was easy to learn to use and if i needed help the online users guide is right there purchasing books couldnt be easier and theres no hard copy to dispose of when youe done i was able to check out a book from the public library with little effort with so many lowcost or nocost books as well as current best sellers theres an endless number to choose from you can use the search function to search by topic or title i like using a stylus pen on the touch screen for that i know i will enjoy my kindle voyage for a long time,5.0

this is the first time that ive used a kindle tablet ive used android and apple devices before and this is a different beast people that are used to an android experience will not be thrilled with this device even though it looks like android the play store is not available and not all of the basic apps are included in the kindle store if i had to do it all over again id spend an extra  or  and get an actual android tablet,3.0
i opened up this package fresh and put two aa batteries in my xbox one controller it only lasted for a few hours of gameplay when i took the batteries out they seem quite warm i used my heat gun and they were f i got a new set of two batteries and placed it in my controller they only kept the controller on for less than a minute when i took the batteries out one burned my finger i grabbed my heat temperature gun and in certain spots it registered over im not going to try and use anymore in any electronics im not sure whats going on here amazon,1.0

this is a fun thing and very useful we are still getting used to it love asking it to tell me what weather forecast is news who won baseball game last night etc great for music just say alexa play some italian dinner music or whatever,5.0
if you shop on amazon all the time this will help make it easier still lots of ads pop up and you cant use apps from nonamazon sources unless you root it and that is complicated this is not a realistic alternative to an ipad or galaxy note if you just want to a device to shop on amazon with youll love it,2.0
as good as any brand name batteries,5.0
i like the tablet great price but the charging cord is to short and there isnt an indicator light to inform you when the tablet is charging,3.0
it is nice to get information i normally dont here and to get the type of music i listen to played when i ask,4.0
easy to read and maneuver just the right size well worth it,4.0
these batteries are awesome for kids toys that dont have moving parts and only music also works great in remotes and things like that great value for what you get would definitely recommend to a friend,4.0
i mainly use this tablet to read my kindle books on but it also handles playing music and watching videos fine great for social media as well a perfect first tablet for someone who has yet to experience a tablet or smart mobile technology definitely buy a decent sized micro sd card when you get it though as the real space you receive after purchase is more like  gb because the os takes so much space on the device,3.0
awesome and very cheap but would recommend awwwwwwww,5.0
they seem to work well ive only used three of the pack thus far but that item is still going strong,4.0
i have had an older version of this kindle and i really like it i decided to buy one for my sister as we share a love of reading she was very surprised and immensely pleased,5.0
im not sure these are lasting as long as more wellknown brands maybe i just got a bad batch not sure,3.0
the resolution on the games is not good i didnt even try to watch netflix because i knew it wouldnt show clearly also it is slow using the internet i assumed it would look and work like android but i wrong everything is amazon which i am unfamiliar with honestly it is better for reading books i returned for something more diverse and better,2.0

i bought three of these as christmas gifts for my grandsons ages  i didnt think about the type of playstore available for them to get games they were disappointed as they were unable to get some of the games they were used to in the playstore unless they paid for them one of them has to be returned as it will not hold a charge which has been frustrating for the child who is trying to play his games,3.0

i like my show but i cant say i love it for being the priciest piece of my collection of alexa devices it has probably the worst microphone getting it to respond is frustrating at times where i have no problem with a standard echo besides this it all works as advertised id wait for the second generation im sure they can work the kinks out,3.0
got it for my  daughters for christmas and they very happy,5.0
one of the best media player options for streaming tv,5.0
i was using the old fire tv but this one is better after all the updates,3.0
i have a pretty fast and stable internet connection mbps downso when i tried to stream some k content it kept buffering to the point that it just wouldnt load the video anymore even streaming p content had some issues so i used the dedicated apps on my tv to see if i had the same problem nope it worked flawlessly this product just plain sucks,1.0
really expected a chord with it for the price we paid very dissapointed,1.0
its a good tablet fast durable and easy to use i especially love the parental features that are available i am more of a fan of android tablets but for a little toodler this is far better,5.0
great sound for music use it for a reminder each day kind of a to do list when i need time or temp just ask alexa,3.0
the kindle line is great for easily syncing into existing amazon accounts  its a great tablet for basic functions like internet use video streaming music streaming apps etcetcetc however the tablet cannot currently stream downloaded movies from ultraviolet which is a pain for most users that primarily bought this device for that purpose i would currently not recommend the purchase of this device until you find out that amazon has fixed the issue if one of your criterias for the perfect tablet is to be able to watch downloaded movies,2.0
this was the nd time that i have ordered amazon batteries only to find they all had about a half charge,2.0

the amazon fire tablet is definitely not the best tablet out there but its definitely the best at this price point it has all of the features i was looking for without the fluff it may be limiting if you dont have an amazon account but its not a deal breaker i think this is a great tablet for those who arent looking for all of the bells and whistles,4.0

i waited to write this review until i had tried nearly all of the batteries that i ordered most of them did not have any power in them the few that did work lasted maybe an hour i pitched the remaining  because i cannot depend on them at this point maybe i just got a bad batch but these are the worst collection batteries i have ever used i would not recommend these to anyone else based on my experience,1.0
do not hold charge as well as major brands,2.0
the basic aa batteries that can only do its job well i havent tested it about its life span yet but seems not bad as you can have a great number of them to use for a long timethey are excellent kind batteries for the price though it is not better than some other it is as good quality of most brands because you just have pay extra money for the brand which is a waste of moneyi dont have any reason to pay a higher price product,5.0

you can absolutely not beat a kindle fire unless you are my  year old son haha but seriously at the price and the beatings they take they are worth it every time and with the cloud storage i dont even mind having to replace it every year,4.0
the tap offers all of the conveniences of amazons alexa in a battery powered portable bluetooth speaker it has a hands free option it works well both as a way to take alexa on the road and as your primary alexa device at home the tap doesnt sound as good as other bluetooth speakers in its price range its not waterproof and alexa doesnt work at all without wifi but still pretty cool and heaper than the echo,5.0
great tablet for a great price and size would highly recommend ,5.0
this product works better than the smart tv function of our current tv simplifies the process and especially the search function no more clicking and scrolling thru the alphabetjust speak it and let it search for you  that alone is worth the ,5.0
the first time i buy my first tablet it came on but it only showed that it needed to reeboot it then shut off by its self,1.0
i paid about  less than the going price for this i cant complain for any reason on this based on what was paid is it the perfect tablet well there are some limitations however ive paid far more in the past for comparable tablets that didnt offer any more than this i picked up multiple ones and they are scattered through the house and all being put to use,5.0
out of the kindles i purchased does not work the date and time will not set properly therfore it is unable to connect to the wifi contacted amazon they acknowledged the problem but directed me back to best buy since they have a day back return policy on this product well i am unable to make it back into the store by the time the return policy is up,1.0
a great price to be surebut every flameless candle i have put these into has been very dim when i replaced with duracell and local grocery store brand as well the candles are noticeably brighter dont think ill be buying amazonbasics batteries again soon  which is a bummer i have always been impressed with amazonbrand products but these batteries are all that,3.0

i returned this item because i couldnäôt get a keyboard with a case to go with it,3.0
every single battery leaked battery acid after the first few charges or uses some while in the device it was powering and others while in the charging station i thought perhaps it could be the charging station i was using so i purchased another brand but it didnt make a difference i also never left the batteries in the charger once they were fully charged this happened with the aaa batteries i purchased as well and when i say leaked battery acid im talking about literal puddles of acid that would pool under the charging station or begin leaking from the device i had to throw away a few childrens toys as well as an xbox  controller the skin on the tips of my fingers peeled away a few times as well from overexposure to the battery acid after having to clean so many surfaces and devices from it getting everywhere please dont buy this product they are completely ineffective and its simply an unsafe product all in all purchasing these batteries cost me around  in having to buy replacements for the devices they ruined,1.0
love what i got works perfect good for my son he loves it,5.0

its very fast and offers k video allows you to download rd party software to the device cant beat it,5.0
works great until i had forgotten that amazon fire did not come with google playstore i looked up how to add playstore to the  fire there are many videos on youtube that showed how to add playstore to the fire all seemed to add it ok but the loss performance of the fire was noticeable there were several apps that failed to work at all or lost features one example was lifetime it was slow to load and failed to bring up chromecast one reason i hoped for this app would work was my samsung and vizio smart tvs dont offer this app i found a old tablet i had forgotten i had i loaded lifetime and works perfect i guess what it boils down to it you are after apps on the playstore get a non amazon tablet it is just easier to use apps should work and you dont have to fool around trying to adapt playstore if playstore isnt critical then im sure this a a great little table,3.0
great easy tablet for a reasonable price not the most super powerful it can get the job done for simple tasks such as surfing the web checking email playing youtube etc screen is clear and responsive great inexpensive tablet,5.0

apps run okay but the real problem is streaming and internet browsing im telling you generic tablets are faster i thought it was my internet at first but all my other devices work phenomenally fast i first noticed this after i started using it but i thought i would give it a shot ive decided to return this and exchange for another  tablet tomorrow this is because i couldnt even watch a simple youtube video todayheres what i did like its name brand the games are nice and mostly ad free it uses android  but uses their own app store reading books is great library app is kinda slow but still worksperfect cheap tablet for kids age  to  maybe,2.0
bought it for  to replace my aging kindle fire hdx  was excited about the size  larger faster processor and expandable storagei should have read the reviews comixology purchases only download to the internal storage not external   gb fills up after  downloads the screen resolution is noticeably pixilated when reading textstill one star for value if bought for  one star for build solid and one if youre a amazon prime member  able to take advantage of video  music which will download to external memory,3.0
i bought the echo for my  year old daughter she loves it very useful and works great easy to use,5.0
i didnt expect a lot at this price but i also did not expect both of my tablets to be riddled with deadstuck pixels right out of the box i have a third arriving in the mail and am just praying that i am at least good for  waiting on its arrival before doing the trip for returnreplacement just in case that one needs to go as well maybe just bad luck but definitely worth noting for anyone who may also be inconvenienced by having to do a returneverything else seems good though when you can look past the display issues but may be worth waiting until these defective lots have been disbursed and the issues have been correctedi am sure if you dont have these display issues that the product deserves more than  stars but if you can see things from my perspective it is kind of difficult to recommend this to anyone for the time being if the display did not have these pixel issues i could see this easily being a  star recommendation if you do a little research you will see that there are definitely some lot numbers that are more problematic than others so this is not just a rare incident if it is for you and you plan to grab one from a brick and mortar location do yourself a favor and just boot it up before you drive home ,2.0
decent batteries ok life,3.0
bought it for my momits going to be easy for her to use,4.0
these batteries are fairly priced for their quality which is to say they need replacing  or  times more often than a name brand battery,1.0
for the price you cant really go wrong but they don last longthe only problem is that the battery life is not long at all if you are using these in a tv remote or similar remotes they will last  monthsif you use these in a flashlight or power toothbrush or similar items they only last about a monthit seems that these dont last long in items that you need to use daily for longer periods of time but if you are using these for a tvstb remote or a holiday decoration that plays music they will last much longer approx  months,3.0
would buy again in a heart beat these seem to be lasting as long as our name brand batteries in our under cabinet lights but  the cost,5.0
more then half dont work,2.0
i prefer the ipad but its okay for the cost just to many ads tho,3.0

my initial impression of this was very good the material is nicer than the shiny stuff on my hama cd binders and the netting trim gives a nice appearance compared to plain look of most budget cd bindersthere are  pages with  disc pockets each  per side giving a total of  capacity the pages are hung from the spine in two groups of  by that i mean that  pages all have a single attachment point to the plastic spinethis is where the first problem with this binder lies because each group of  pages shares the same anchor point in the spine the pages cannot sit flat once full of discs they bend and arch and apart from looking tatty this puts a lot of tension across the plastic film with longterm usage i suspect this plastic film will will tear due to the tension it also makes it awkward to browse the binder as the pages dont sit flat it may even crack or bend your discsi look to my hama  binder to see how it should be done  it only has  pages and yet they were smart enough to hang them from the spine in  bundles of  this spreads out the pages and allows easy browsing of the binder without putting any of the pockets under tensionafter just  weeks in storage i opened the binder and the corners of all the pages have become dogeared by themselves this is due to the poor design and poor fit of the binder pages when filled with discs again it is not a problem i have seen with my other disc binders my twoyearold hama binders look as good as newoverally this binder has a lot of storage at a good price if thats all you want you will probably be happy with the product but sloppy design prevents it from being anything more than a mediocre binder i feel that whoever designed this did not bother to fill it with discs to see how it would cope,2.0
not the best and the brightest in the market bought two of them and one got damaged within the second month best buy was not taking it back and amazon asked a price of a whole new one for repair good price though but high possibility that the product might not last too long,2.0
most speaker like this will be over usd but this one is less than that price with a great sound quality,5.0
i purchased this for my husband to play his games onclash of clans the bb salesperson assured me he would be able to use it for that got it home turns out you can only usegets apps from the amazon store which does not include games like clash of clans it was already opened and set up so i gave it to my  yr old he plays a few games on it and watches some movies but would much rather play with the ipad,2.0

the paperwhite makes it possible to condense a lot of books in one small device thereby saving your house from looking like a warehouse you can pack a lot of books into your suitcase with a paperwhite if your device gets stolen lost or trashed you may lose a substantial portion or all of your personal library the paper white allows you to increase size of print big advantage use of hand gestures to turn page allows faster reading its awkward to hold lying in bed an attachable gripper would be helpful to hold and read at same time,4.0
this product is fun but it does not understand a lot of your questions it is not a user friend item so it is limited to very few things it can do for the money it needs a lot of work i was expecting more but it is a toy to have,3.0

i was tired of buying duracell batteries only to have them start leaking and have to be thrown away even before i could use them at all so far these batteries have not leaked at all i do believe that wrapping them as they are in just a few at a time has helped keep moisture from seeping into them i have no complaints thus far with them,5.0

an okay reader reading from an ipad mini is better under all conditions except outside in sunlight plus with the ipad you can play games web search etc the kindle library function is not nearly as good as the kindle app on the ipad where you can see many more of your books on a page and scroll through them all quickly versus the slow swipe function of the kindle i also do not like the page turn of the kindle versus apple every page turned on kindle is like slow motion and about every fifth page refreshes entirely i actually have to go to the top of the next page slowly in order to not have to wait for the kindle slow page turn even the reading in the outdoors feature of the kindle is not as great as reviewers indicate as there is still the sun glare on pages that you have to deal with although at least you can read with it outdoors the kindle also suffers from a shadow along the bottom of the screen the explanation is that it is actually a shadow that is between the lights that are shining upward for night time reading draw your own conclusions as to whether that is good engineering it is worse on some of the devices i saw than on others kindle serves the purpose for reading at the beach and not worrying if it accidently gets damaged i would never take an ipad to the beach but the kindle is almost disposable in contrast maybe  stars is being a bit generous but it is a good supplement to the ipad if apple ever makes their device so it can be used outside without a glare then i dont see any market for the kindle at that point not sorry i have a kindle but for what i decided to buy it for reading at beach it is at the price point where it is not really worth it i still read paper books for those who remember what those are and those still work perfectly for beach reading,3.0
as good as expected,5.0

i bought a first generation kindle fire a few years back when it was on sale for something like  and loved it it took a bit of a beating and i had recently begun to think about buying a replacement i think that original tablet would probably be more comparable to the fire hd  or something so my experience with this version is colored by the higher quality first generation model i also use a surface pro tablet as my personalwork computer so that too probably color my opinion out of the box this is lighter than the original upon powering up the original bookshelf carousel is now replaced by a more standard tablet home screen in terms of processing speed this version feels a little slow games i had on the original seem to struggle a bit on the new fire webbrowsing is not terrible but is not terribly fast either in the end if you want a good ereader on a budget with a few extra features this is a great buy if youre looking for a serious small tablet you may wish to add a bit more to your budget and get one of the older siblings,3.0

this is the first amazon product ive purchased i thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really cant be much difference between alkaline batteriesi am a working musician teacher i sing with a band and use a shure wireless beta  mic a normal set of alkaline batteries last about  hours in my mic the first gig i used these with was about   hours with the mic on and by the end of the gig the light on the mic showing battery was showing that the battery was about to die i was just lucky that it lasted long enough for the entire gig usually i can get two full gigs out of an alkaline battery just as a comparison i usually buy the cheapest boxes of batteries at lowes those batteries are only slightly more expensive than the amazon basics and last twice as long in my mici cant say how these batteries work in other things but i can say that for what i use them for they are a big waste of money i would rather use batteries that cost  more and last twice as long,1.0

so i love my electronics i have an ipad but when i saw this on sale i got myself one just to have since i am a prime member i figured i could use this too the only thing i like about this is that you an expand the the storage if the ipad had that option it would be amazing so since i then expanded the memory i can have more movies to watch offline camera is horrible so i would say if you have a younger child this may be decent but nothing compares to an ipad,3.0
it does everything i need it to do but the battery life is short lived i bought it with the intentions to keep my toddler entertained the battery last about  hours if it runs continuously if it is intermittent use it lasts about  hours worth it for the price,3.0

i bought myself a kindle earlier this summer and love it so much that i decided to get one for my ten year old i thought she was spending too much time engaging in mindless activities on her phone and computer and thought this might be a good alternative she has responded surprisingly well one feature that i really like is the dictionary if she comes across a word she doesnt know or cant read she can tap on it and the dictionary will pop up defining the word this enables her to use her inference skills to decode the word or understand the meaning better this has been a nice addition to her bedtime routine,5.0

there is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it the biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that i have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen this means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an ipad can do with guided access activated,3.0

or at least a future id like to be living in lets get this straight as a prime member you can get this for  at that rate think of it as a wireless speaker that you can just issue spoken instructions to an alarm clock that you can shout at alexa shut up in the morning and it will obey you  its my half asleep morning power trip set a timer for when youre cooking fact check your friend while you argue with them pso my common use cases aside heres what is good about echo speech recognition works really well esp for brief phrases it can hear you from pretty much anywhere in the room and is pretty accurate with the wake word ive been using alexa as a music player its really nice to be able to just ask for a song by name and have it just come up without having to hunt through a playlist connect to the bluetooth speaker etc purchasing music is pretty seamless as if amazon needed another way to get you to spend money  iheart radio integration if youre into that kinda thinghere is what is not so great speech recognition for longer phrases needs a couple of attempts maybe because of my accent eg alexa play the song the troubles by u as a music player its a bit lacking in bass sometimes while its playing music you have to use the wake word once or twice to gets its attention bing search really rolls eyesid love to see in the future integration with fire tv so that i can simply say alexa play the sopranos on my tv google search being able to send a message to a friend in my contacts alexa message xyz blah blah blahoverall its a pretty cool product and id love to see what it looks like over time,4.0

i have owned kindles for many years and have always been very happy with their portability performance and ease of use the highly expandable memory is what lead me to purchase this kindle for my son there are only two areas that i am very disappointed the first in the parental control settings in order to ensure that my son cannot make endless onetouch purchases and i mean oneeasy little touch i must set the controls either off or on the problem with this is that he then has no internet access or extremely limited access so limited that he cannot access content i normally allow him to accessbig problem now amazon is pretty good about refunding unintended app purchases there is a cancel button but then you must wait days or more for the refund to be credited this is an issue that i am getting more frustrated with as we move through time with this purchase the second issue amazons kindle app store is weak if you can find some of the apps that you are searching for they may not be entirely supported by the device such as facebooka major app and a major downfall to kindle use because of this last issue both my son and i have apple devices to supplement what we cannot do on our kindle all this being said however my son and i both very much enjoy what the kindles do have to offer so they get a good rating because of thishowever because of the issues i discussed it was difficult to choose between an average and good rating,4.0

the concept is great we have had some issues with certain streams being unplayable and it is sometimes difficult to find what you are looking for there needs to be an easier way to maneuver and find the things you want to watch,3.0
mainly use it for playing music was going to connect to apple music but found it much easier to use amazon music and amazon offers a lower priced plan if you just use amazon music for alexa i have an outlet switch connected which is convenient for turning onoff lights it has a good speaker for playing music i think alexa is comparable to siri,4.0
these r the worst batteries ever amazon should stop selling they last a couple of weeks on a clock everyone ive used i should send back,1.0

i am definitely happy with my purchase its a very good android box even if most of the content seems to be amazon content with the ability to sideload install other android apps not from the amazon store this makes one of the top android boxes also the ability to play some games makes it a plus just buy a microsd card since memory is limited to gb on this box,4.0

i got this tablet for christmas and only used it for one day the next day i could not use it it keep glitching when i got it the box was opened and it had an inspect sticker on the box i guess that is what best buy does i think someone switched it out i took it back to best buy to see if someone could fix it and they said it would be  to fix or call amazon why would i pay  to fix a tablet that was  amazon is replacing my defected one for free after many attempts to fix it,1.0
drains out quickly like cheap dollar tree stuff,2.0
too many advertisements to get through a little tough to adjust to coming from the apple world,3.0

this table is realy nice for starters this table have lots off free apps its easy to use and u can put in an sd card for more space,3.0
did not work right out of the box bad hard drive read other reviews that stated the same issue would not recommend to anyone save your money,1.0
these batteries are only ok they dont last as long as duracell and when they die its usually instantly one moment they seem to work fine the very next moment they are outputting half power i would say that about half of these batteries just simply died while being used no warning no gradual loss of power simply dead they also seem to be marginally shorter than brandname batteries but to be honest i havent measured them suffice it to say ive decided that i would rather spend the few extra cents per battery on brandname batteries its simply not worth the savings in my opinion ive had similar experience with dollar store batteries,3.0
battiers dont last very long,2.0
bad graphics ugly design good for the price not recommended,2.0
i brought to my  nices and so far they are enjoy it ,4.0
medium durability gonna buy duracell in future do you have great quality rechargeables,3.0

great product for what it is designed for easily modified for kodi,3.0
my niece loves this tablet its very durable but charges slow,5.0
great product for the sale price best buy was offering i am using it not only for music but also doctors appointments birthdays weather and more,5.0
id say for the price it was a decent tablet it did what i needed it to do but the support id say through the app side was a bit rather weak which is the big downfall of this tablet amazon also does a lot of advertisements on the tablet for example the lock screen and multiple pages on your home screens which can be rather annoying and unremoveable otherwise i used it to watch videos surf the web and use a few social media apps good for kids too both videos and games side so id say in general for the price its a decent tablet but if you are looking to do more and have a smoother tablet you might want to pay more for something better,3.0
it is the right size to throw into a purse because it is light weighteasy set up enter your wifi password and amazon login info then wooo the display is bright no dead pixels on mine and responsive touch sensitivity is very goodthe fire  good design and slim in sizegood product with money,4.0
got this as a christmas present for a  year old the tablet has an excellent kids mode that he can navigate easily to play games or watch videos,4.0
in my eyes they die to quickly,4.0
they didnt last as long as say duracellin my opinion,2.0
the product works fine but you need to install a bunch of apps to use to its full potential,3.0
so far the amazon echo has been great especially at the discounted price im still trying things with the echo and i also have the google home and so far im giving the edge to the amazon echo as it looks like they have a head start on features,4.0
ill never buy dollar store batteries again d theyre great id put them on par with energizer or duracell,5.0

great for accessing satellite radio information searches weather reports etc,4.0
i purchased this for my nephew great activities and more for him to learn,4.0
i purchased this for my mother in law she is getting old and wanted something she could seethe font size was never quite right for her and she was often confused by all the attempts this device makes to sell you something it really wasnt a good fit for herthe device died approximately  week after purchase we returned it for a refund,2.0
amazon echo is a smart home device but its not quite as smart as google home it also doesnt integrate with your smartphone as anything more than a mediocre bluetooth speaker i dont care about ordering products from amazon using my voice and i wish alexa would answer my more obscure questions like google doeswhere the echo shines right now though is with smart home integration i use the echo to control my philips hue lights and control all of my home theater devices through my harmony hub and soon full control over my dish hopper through a dishamazon partnership its a bit more expensive than i would have liked and i ended up adding an echo dot to the other room so i didnt have to yell for alexa to hear mein hindsight if you dont need a mediocre bluetooth speaker get the echo dot instead which you can hook to speakers of your own choice,4.0
paper white does not allow you do use books from the library as you cannot load apps only books from amazon are available to read,1.0
price is nice but performance was not sluggish to the point of frustration even to my  year old would be fine as ereader or maybe basic web device,2.0
much better than the echo dot however the fact that you have to touch the button to activate it instead of just talking to it is a bit annoying speaker is fairly powerful for its size,3.0
the purchase was primarily for my husband who is technologychallenged he can now listen to the music he wants when he wants he is still experimenting with asking questions you do have to be careful when talking about alexa because she will respond to your conversation,5.0
it is a neat gadget can do some things like track items for a shopping list and setting timers that are great i would have expected it to be better at telling me things like when is tv show x on and what sound does a cardinal bird make all were met with i didnt understand the question alexa should be more intuitive than that and should learn and grow as you go along she does not you also have to ask things in a way alexa will understand for example you cannot say alexa turn out the lights in the kitchen that does not compute but if you say alexa shut off the lights she will do as you ask i had to start writing down the correct way to ask her things so i would remember them again she needs to learn and adapt not happening so far,3.0
its slippery u cannot hold it it always slips and lots of ads definitely not good if u dont like advertising,1.0
the amazon kindle is a great device for any reader it is simple to use and fits the purpose operating system is a little slow comparing to other devices but gets the job done,4.0
it matters what preference you prefer with tablets i mean if you use windows or google more this might not be for you for me i use amazon music video books and shopping so this tablet is awesome its made especially for amazon ecosystem users its light and has a nice feel i live the blue shade option it has for less blue light when reading,4.0
the device is a good item and i really recommend to everyone,5.0

i bought this item to give as a gift i have my own kindle fire  so i figured the kindle  will be a nice gift for my niece it delivered what i expected a kindle will do for ereaders,4.0

worst performance in aa alkaline batteries we have ever seen we bought these for use in our manufacturing company and we used them in a wide variety of applications everyone has had poor performance for clocks that used to have batteries last three years this brand lasted only several weeks same problems when used in a computer mouse by several people laser pointers and other applications we are going back to namebrand aa batteries this is the worst rating i have given any product in a long time,1.0

i had to sideload google play services to be able to download from the google play store or use google chrome as a web browser as this tablet was designed to be exclusive to amazon,3.0
very easy to usenavigate userfriendly interface only con is that its a bit sluggish for the avid user which was just improved in the rd generation of the fire stick better processor,4.0
slow advertisements on home screen are annoying can be stopped for a fee,3.0
i gave one star because they were batteries and did not explode in my face which is a major plus however if you need batteries for anything you use on a daily basis outside a tv remote then do not buy these batteries do not last as long as duracell or energizer by far and i wish i was getting paid to say that spend the extra dollars and buy a better battery,2.0
good tablet but very limited in apps only to basic surfing,3.0
i have been a book fan and was surprised how much i love this,5.0
i find these batteries fail in a short time on items like wireless thermometers and wall clocks on an average changing is required within a month i would not purchase these again,1.0
purchased for my  year old mom so she could adjust the font size and find the books for her book club less expensively,5.0
spend a few more dollars and get a branded one these discharge very fast had to keep changing my wall clock battery every  months when i had these got an energizer battery and that stayed for more than a year didnt expect amazon product to be of such poor quality,1.0
i bought this for my year old she liked it for the first few days and then she went back to playing with my ipad if i hadnt already introduce her to the ipad i think she would have been fine with this,3.0
amazon show is pretty cool it can help with things like cooking recipe homework and other things but its restricted to only amazon partner things if google comes out with something similar i would have definitely chosen that over the show no youtube,3.0
these batteries last about  of a stander energizer dont be suckered in by the price would not buy again,1.0
it works well for what i needed i purchased for great price on black friday,4.0
my husband loves the fire stick it gives all the old movies he loves and he can do amazing things with the sound as the fire stick allows many adjustmentsstreaming is faster too,5.0
so easy to use my parents can even figure it out good quality,5.0
you need to have amazone prime in order to have music,4.0
hopefully this will at least work as an ereader otherwise amazon has it locked up so tight one cannot do much else with it and even with my fiber optic wifi it is slower than cold molasses in january in canada well i needed a kindle ereader and for  that is ok,1.0
died too fast sorry rather stay with the batteries sold in stores,2.0
i was in the middle of moving and didnt want to get a new labtop and found this amazon fire for a good price ive been very happy with it if your looking for a cheap easy to use tablet look no further,5.0
i love it when amazon brings out commonly used products under their own name that perform well and are priced right these aaa batteries are just another example of amazons buying power and smart branding because why would any company put their name and reputation on a product if they werent convinced that it would be a true value to consumers the last thing that they want consumers to do is identify amazon with anything but qualityso buy these knowing that they are a good value and work properly and if for some reason you get a bad batchwhich can happen to anyonesimply return them under their return policy and get a replacement box,5.0
love my alexia best buy this year love the freedom of requesting music verbally and increasing or decreasing the loudness the kids love asking her questions and i really like getting the weather and not having to wait on the tv for the news,5.0
i bought the echo based on a suggestion from a relative its got some nice features and the easter eggs are fun to find sometimes i feel like i have to yell at it for the echo to hear me and theres a large amount of stuff that it doesnt know amazon is working on that i would definitely recommend getting a dot as well if you are placing the echo more than  feet from where youd normally be talking to it from,4.0
great for reading not great for playing games needs more storage,3.0
i am glad to have made this purchase i am pleased with the amazon stick,5.0
i dont know if i would buy thus brand again seems like they dont last as long as duracell,1.0
it was working great then all of a sudden it wouldnt come on,3.0
my daughter loves her kindle fire easy to setup parental controls,5.0
our experience with all amazon batteries have been bad they dont last nearly as long as a duracel or energizer i literally replaced my computer mouse battery with an amazon aaa battery  days ago and its already out we have to replace everything that has an amazon battery constantly will not buy these again,1.0
am used to kindle fire which i love no light to read by in the dark hard to navigate this was a gift  would never purchase on my own,1.0
great price and work just as well as the more expensive ones,5.0
work perfectly great value very happy,5.0
its neat it does what all other amazon alexis do but a little more i feel as if should still do more,3.0
a wonderfully designed device but its use is fairly limited i bought it primarily to use as a smart home control device however although it allows you to turn on and off lights you cannot add timers to the control instructions for instance you cannot tell the echo to turn off a light in  minutes you can only tell it to turn it off or on immediately finding that out was incredible disappointing i dont know understand why it would be so hard to add such a feature,2.0
good product for  external sd card is nice option,3.0
the kids are having a great time with the amazon fire the best function is the parent monitoring availablility,5.0
i am not really a fan of tablets but when this one came out it had my attention i bought it as a gift to surprise my husband with and he absolutely loves it love the fact that you can set the background and its not as hard to operate like the older kindles,5.0
purchased and installed item onto kindle but am still trying to figure out how storage onto new sd card works i know it is me but i think i will have to return to store to get someone to show me how to operate,3.0
pretty slow but for the price i guess it works ok,3.0
itäôs great that you can enhance capacity via a memory card but the fact that a brand new product stops working within an hour of opening it reduces confidence significantly,1.0
very poor battery life did not even last  minutes in my device where ive had top notch energizer batteries that lasted weeks if not monthsthese just do not compare to top of the line batteries maybe good for a tv remote but thats about it,1.0
for  i couldnt ask for more aside from access to a ridiculous amount of books i can listen to music download apps play games watch videos take photos record videos front  rear facing camera check emails and surf the web although you have to pay for most bookvideo purchases amazon also offers amazon prime for a month free  after which makes some purchases less expensive you can also tack on kindle unlimited free st month also  a month after to download up to  kindle unlimited books at a time as for the possible cons the lock screen is set as a rotation of sponsored ads which is why this tablet is so cheap if this bothers you you can remove the ads for  on amazon the screencamera resolution and speaker output isnt anything to write home about but it is absolutely great for the price the glare while using the tablet can also be bothersome but i purchased an antiglare screen protector to resolve that issue with the holidays approaching this is the perfect gift for those on a budget this would have been the perfect gift for me had i not already purchased it for myself,5.0
meh it works i find it difficult to navigate i also have an ipad mini this seems to be less intuitive than the ipad,3.0
works great and holds chaege as well as and battery i have had,4.0
i purchased amazon fire for my son after reading enough reviews about this product it works ok for ebooks but very slow for internet streaming and downloading also the touch function is not very sensitive which you need to hit the same button couples of time to make it work,3.0

these batteries are just a tiny bit too short to work in every aaa device beware,3.0
my son was excited to get this and it kept closing on him returned it but they dont have any in stock to exchange frustrated and my son is upset,3.0
reading a book its great working with pdf files not so great also please be aware that amazon customer service will treat you like a pariah because you purchased this kindle from best buy instead of directly through their store,2.0
the unit had good screen resolution and the size was not bad but not at all impressed with the amazon operating system,2.0
profound content provided by this tv box plus rd party apps you can watch free tv and sports,5.0
took way to long to receive and then some were corroded,1.0
the advertisement promises a  channel boat it is not  only one channel consequently kids cant play simultaneously with more than one boat which was the reason i bought several simple false advertising the main reason i bought this model over others was that it was promised with multiple channels,1.0
over priced due to the cost of kindle at  should come with kindle,1.0
im truly disappointed with these batteries,1.0
i bought this to test before i bought more as christmas gifts for my grand kids seems to work fine,4.0
during my first recharging they were leaking and wrapping was coming off a waste of money,1.0
this is a great little tablet for the younger generation,4.0

my grandchildren have mastered the kindles they are ages  and can do anything with them i have some avid readers and the four have discovered how to play games against each other with each having a kindle i love this kindle it was easy to download everything and link to internet,5.0

i bought the fire for my husband to play his games on he enjoys it but its not as fast as hed like,4.0
low quality batteries  they die after using a few times better to go with big brand name,1.0
not happy at first as battery was totally dead when i got it however after charging its working ok,3.0
leds run thru these so fast man but im lazy and amazon delivers so i keep buying them dont have a time sheet but i have one of those harbour freight free with purchase lights and it seemed to last  hours before i noticed it was dim so thats good i guess as its still very bright just not new never been used brightusually i replace  out the  batteries every  weeks but i work on a bike and car and have never had any led go out or get unusable dim during a job with a fresh change,4.0
bought it in order to watch nbc but the nbc app isnt compatible so now i have a paperweight,2.0

easy to setup and use tons of apps and games to choose from,5.0
upgraded from a  to  kindle fire and it is so worth it great picture good storage love my kindle,5.0
bought this for a bedroom tv the interface is geared toward amazon prime members so most of the items on the main screen are of no use to me you must do some scrolling to get to the apps page so for people who arent prime members its not as convenient as other streaming devices my solution was to install firestarteri would have bought a roku but amazon fire is the only streaming device to support the tivo app so unless i wanted to spend quite a bit more for a tivo mini  roku this was my only choice but after installing firestarter im satisfied the tivo app does not do everything a tivo mini does it just allows us to watch recordings from our tivo bolt in the living roomhad it come stock with a display option to switch to a less primespecific startup screen i would have given it  stars but amazon is trying to promote prime so thats not going to happen,4.0
this is a good tablet for someone just wanting to surf the internet would buy again if was only surfing,3.0
now i know why these are so inexpensive im baffled as to how theyve earned such high reviews ive used them in a variety of devices portable led lights that i utilize maybe once every two months for events in a batteryoperated soapdispenser in tap lights in a closethallway in toys in the soapdispenser they lasted three weeks i thought the dispenser must be faulty switched them out next set of these batteries lasted a week in the led lights the batteries lasted five hours less in the toys and tap lights at this rate ill have used the whole box of  batteries in less than  months what a wasteful useless product,1.0

when it works its great but for some reason it doesnt always answer me when it doesnt answer me i turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesnt work at that time it was easy to set up with the phone app doesnt seem to matter where the phone is when it isnt working ive tried close and far and in between so a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesnt,3.0
maybe i had higher expectationin general i will not recommend since the service of amazon solving situations is not as good as in other products ive had so much troubles with the amazon free time i am even not longer using it it was one of the big features on the advertisment i will recommend to look for other alternatives before to take a decision on buying this product,2.0
dont know i bought as gift for my nephew we will see,2.0
for the money the best tablet you can buy i bought a bunch of these for my nieces to play with i love my kindle and for the money it allows them to do a wide variety of activities,5.0
for the most part the kindle  is a great deal for the money the volume was giving me a problem but it was resolved quickly by amazon overall quite happy,4.0
it wasnt worth my money to be honest but it is good whenever your bored,3.0
awesome tablet at a good pricei love the size of the tablet,5.0
i love the learning games that he doesnt even realize they are learning games,4.0
horrible did not last  hour in my devices do not buy,1.0
hard to use lots of ads and randomly closes apps,2.0
i like shopping with amazon and have purchased several amazon brand products however i would not recommend anyone buy these batteries i opened up the box and took a pack of four batteries out of the case and one was leaking i threw those away i need batteries for one of my sons toys so opened up another pack and put the batteries in and you guessed it there was no charge in the batteries at all about half of the batteries in the box were dead on arrival the other ones had a charge but did not last long save your self the headache and buy energizers or something else you will pay more but they work i tried to return this pack but i was out of the  day window to return so im out the money,1.0
i bought these for my cameras they dont last any time at all i wont buy these again,1.0
i have always been pleased with kindle fire in fact i think i wore out my previous one for some reason i cannot turn this one on and went to best buy to ask someone to help me with it but it seems you need an appointment even for this probably simple chore,3.0
i initially liked the product the work it does and with the speakers but then with time you feel bored in specific if you are listener of hindi music as the songs are repetitive amazon unlimited music does not holds a very good library of hindi music secondly alexa is probably tuned to answer more of i dont know after purchasing i realized and read more reviews that google home provides much better answers to queries put against it and has a wide range of hindi music,3.0
did not fix my leaking water pump,1.0
i enjoy the kindle fire but it is not meant for heavy lifting good for reading books and web searching but amazon app store doesnt have many of the normal apps found in google play or apple app store great value for the price however,4.0
looking for a streaming media box this is a fine android based oneit has an ethernet port streams does p amazon and if you have all android stuff its finei really dont like that it doesnt have a volume controlthe only difference between this and the fire stick for me is the internal storage capacity and the ethernet portso but two fire sticks instead of one box unless you want to play the apps,3.0
amazon brand batteries are very poor quality dont last more than  months in a remote control which barely uses any power this is shameful and stupid as it diminishes confidence in the amazon brand name,1.0
horrible amazon batteries are the worst i have a battery operated little decorative light string  duracell batteries will light those things for weeks  amazon batteries last about and im not kidding maybe  hours complete waist of money dollar store batteries are better do not purchase these,1.0
this tablet was bought as a gift for my  year old grandson i researched the top selling tablets on line before deciding on this one best purchase ever this tablet will grow with him and even gets mom and dads ok,4.0
arrived quickly and works perfectly very happy with my purchase,5.0
easy to set up and pair other compatible items by enabling skills through the amazon app ive been to best buy twice for information and how to questions and all seems to be going well its only been a week and still have a lot to learn about elexas capabilities,5.0
ive always been a fan of gadgetsand i had to have iti had read some of the reviews that were quite favorable but i had to find out for myselfi absolutely love it the sound is rich and room filling in fact the sound in bigger than its very discreet size,5.0
by far the worst batteries i have ever bought i regret my purchase of  packs half of each box came without power and the ones that did were half life if u found this helpful please rate helpful thanks,1.0
makes book downloading and reading easy as ever so compact and lightweight too,5.0
i bought this as a gift to my parents the unfortunate part was that i was a little misinformed about the connectivity between the tablet and a chrome cast that i purchases as well as part of the gift the tablet is not compatible with the table and that was a little disappointing other than that its an alright product,3.0
bought this as a gift for my mother so that she could watch netflix and hulu while in the hospital took her a bit to get used to as she was used to her ipad but overall i like this product only drawback is lack of appstore content namely clash of clans clash royale pokemon go etc,4.0
hard to argue with an amazon fire tv or stick i bought this to replace my previous one that only did p having had both i would say you wont go wrong with either i bought the firetv for the direct internet plug in capability which i figured would be a concern with wifi,5.0
the sound in this is on par with other high end portable speakers that however is really just the tip of the iceberg if you have amazon prime you can access all your music just by asking also this works if you have phillips hue so you can turn the lights off and on with your voice,5.0
it is ok for the average user but it os not good enough for kodi the interface is ok but a little too busy for me i did not like the fact that i could not use my universal harmony remote with it jodi also takes almost an hour to set up and it buffers way more than on the shield,3.0
limited apps screen not as easy to touch good for the price,3.0
they run out of juice fast,3.0
i love how easy and interactive product is set up in a snap with easy to follow directions,5.0
we are pretty unhappy with this purchase several of the most popular apps instagram you tube etc are not compatible with this device now i know why the sale on this was so great we can really only run the internet and facebook on this device will be returning and getting a different tablet,3.0
not bad for an entrylevel tablet pretty much what i expected for the price i paid for it my fouryearold loves it,3.0
easy to useeasy to connect with cellphone and tablet to play youtube the product said it will upscale to k quality but the picture show on the tv is the same as regular product without k,3.0
the table is good for someone that just need some entertainment and make amazon purchases,3.0
works exactly as i hoped and have had no issues there is virtually every app you might need available to you,4.0
dont seem to last very long,1.0
after about two weeks i ended up returning this item it constantly froze and when it was working it was no faster than my fire stickthe voice search was a joke im pretty tied in to the amazon ecosystem i love my echo but i was disappointed with this device and for a hundred dollars no thanks,2.0
it is very good but very limited to the number of applications that it can support,3.0
the best product to come out of amazon just love my echo works well as smart hub,5.0
very reasonably priced,5.0
i purchased this for traveling i can access my email books and games without lugging my laptop im sure i will learn more as needed,4.0
you cant beat the price but ive had some of these batteries just die on me after less than a month of use,3.0
nice size and very nice video quality finger swiping much more effective than using a stylus,4.0
i love my fire tv and has allowed me to cut all chords with any tv service providers,5.0
i am using it for my  year old and she loves it,5.0
terrible the batteries drained way too fast we put them in wreaths with lights and went dead within  days they were timed for  hours so its not on for long we used energizer batteries last year and worked for the  days that were on display and didnt have to change any but i guess for  for  you get what you pay for will not buy these again,1.0
excellent for reading and has lots of other uses with wifi,5.0
one of the best investments ever work great with all the streaming apps,5.0
bought two for early teenagersthey want books games and it helps to teach responsibility of email and social media use,4.0
although this got great reviews i am still trying to figure it out when it doesnt understand my question i rephrase it and sometimes even then alexa still cant answer i have been reading about how to get the most out of alexa but im actually still on the fence about whether or not i will keep it am i missing something what is it that others see that i dont,3.0
we use battery operated candles with timers the batteries normally have to be changed once a month these cheap batteries lasted  weeks i thought these batteries were a good deal but i was wrong,2.0
the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped took back and got a replacement this one lasted almost a month again took it back and was told i had to deal with amazonfound out thru amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product had to research everything myself,3.0
overall for an alexa product it does the same thing as all the other ones this one is specifically portable and only needs to be put on the base for charging the one main issue is that it is not voice activated meaning it does not listen to you unless you press any of the buttons on top or the mic button in front by having this feature i could see it causing excess battery usage needs to be able to apps better,3.0
upgrade from fire stick and its the best decision i made its fast easy to setup and came with loaded apps no more cable fee,5.0
just speak into the remote and your thrust on a journey through moviesinternet and shopping,5.0
like dos you need to memorize your command and speak it out otherwise it may not understand your command google assistant is smarter also you cant use spotify free account to work around you must add a lot of free music to amazon music into your own amazon music account before you can hear any music google home is more convenient this case as you can start listening to any music channel by your free account from spotify if you have paid account for spotify then not much different here but to do searching you may be disappointed with this tap google home is just much smarter the sound of this tap is very good indeed but i return it because it cant do music alarm also it cant use spotify for free also its search is not smart enough so i switched to google home,2.0
seems to work just as well as other batteries good for using in toys no complaints,4.0
just ask or command the machine does itgetting really lazy now lol,3.0
nice tablet the only downsize i see is you dont have the play store so apps are limited,4.0
exactly what i expected i own three of these already,4.0
good for kids just wanting to play games or watch movies even when purchasing extra gb storage cards,3.0
they dont work still to regular brands,1.0
loved my husbands th generation disappointed in my th generation th generation has  speakers and sound is much louder than the current th generation i purchased this expecting the same quality in sound or better since i use the kindle to watch my tv shows,2.0
idk why i ended up with aaa when i orderd aa oh well,1.0
great size easy to read at night and no glare screen,4.0
no connection to wifi nook color hd work on it,1.0
seems to have a short life span but overall good item,4.0
good product other than having to purchase additional apps for it to work,4.0
work great good price,5.0
was not a fan of this product browsers are extremely slow,1.0
the idea is right but after few weeks needs restarting else it doesnt respond properly compatible devices pairs properly i used lifx bulbs but it couldnt control them with voice says no device found hopefully they will release a software update soon,3.0
over all the product is good and works as advertised but lately it is constantly having issues keeping enet connection and even worse has issues updating we were told this is a larger amazon network issue,3.0
we have only had this product for about a month and theres already a problem with the charging port having to send it back my daycare owns  of them for her own children and their having the same problems with two of theres,2.0
i bought this originally for a younger child to download apps for learning for school and for a few games it works well no issues with that but it is a little harder for him to navigate from my standpoint it is smooth and operates the way i expect it,3.0
my  year old loves it the amazon free time is great a lot of apps free for a small yearly fee,5.0
this is one of the best purchases i have ever made,5.0
dont seem to last long i think dollar general batteries are just as good,3.0
i buy a lot of these i dont think that the longevity is exceptional but they are inexpensive in bulk worry about recycle maybe need to consider rechargeables,3.0
great price arrived quickly and last just as long as any of the name brand batteries we have used in the past,5.0
if your looking for an inexpensive tablet to get you started than this is the one quick set up and easy to use for all your basic needs,5.0
speaker is pretty loud and i love that i can take with me but the only downside is you have to hold the home button to use alexa,3.0
amazon echo plus is a fun product it requires time to explore its skills it copes well with accents however the echo have to be placed as center as possible to get the best listening results it is a great first step towards a smart home but there are more accessories required to connect the house together if you live outside of us you may find some of the features limited at the moment hopefully this will change with time and also more skills will be available for local services,5.0
this thing is not half bad for the price bought it as a gift for my wife and she loves it,4.0
very reponsive processor high quality display expandable storage up to gb via sd card lots of free apps via amazon app store decent battery life and inexpensive price what more can you ask for,5.0
this device plays on the fact that you must subscribe to their stuff or this is just a empty cylinder that tells you the weather and thats it and even then there is a subscription required for everything google home at least plays general music lists and a number of other key actions,1.0
i ended up returning this tablet for the price  the tablet performed very well however if you have the money do yourself a favor and step out of the amazon lineup the ipads are great in my opinion the best but they cost  from what ive experienced the samsung tab a line is a solid tablet for a  budget you can often find one on sale for  and its a pretty good bangforthe buckif the money is your only concern then this will probably work well enough for you,3.0
alexa answers maybe  out of  questions we ask her  she uses bingcom and it is really bad her standard answer is  i dont know the answer to this question we ask her easy questions about stats or people we also have a google home and it answers almost every question right,1.0
some work some dont some will power my tv remote but the same batteries wouldnt power a different type of remote i wont buy these again,1.0
doesnt answer as many questions as led to believe should have google instead of bing a simple alarm clock is all i use it for not much good for anything else would have returned it but i like gadgets  dont recommend purchasing,2.0
news weather and music that is pretty much all we use it for if you have amazon prime its nice to just request certain music to play sound is ok not terrible not great,3.0
the screen flush with the sides is great the glass feeling is really nice i dont use the side buttons for page turning but only because of habit they are great and the need for pressure allows me to hold the kindle without changing pages but the price is painful it is a splurge purchase since the paperwhite is just about as good in nearly every respect,4.0
first off the tablet is  so dont go in expecting it to be on par with the latest ipad for the price you pay though you get a really good tablet screen is a little lower than p but you have access to all of the kindle books amazon prime the new fire os which looks alot better than the all black on the last few kindle fires this model is only gb but storage is expandable i have a gb micro sd in my tablet recommended,4.0
very low quality tablet it lags on games but what do you expect for  however you can still do most things youd expect to do with a tablet,1.0
they are batteries they work dont know what else to say except they were ridiculously cheap,5.0
i am enjoying the echo i get news weather and other information that i like each day it is nice that i can also play the music i have with amazoni add new tasks all the time and i am still learning what i can do with it,4.0
do not pay attention to their ad it says the plug is not included with the kindle and it absolutely is if they lie about this sort of thing what else do you think the lie about steer clear these guys are rip off artist,1.0
you will find detailed reviews of kindle paper white online i will cover some other general observationsif you send a pdf to your kindle email  it will sync it to your kindle but the fonts appear small when you open it in kindle paper white and the menu option did not allow me to change font size you have to convert the pdf to be able to adjust font sizeyou will be able to convert your existing pdfs by sending a email with convert in subject line and including the attachment and sending it to your kindle email refer to amazon settings for finding out your kindle email however it may lose the tables or other code diagrams from the original pdf so that is a pain varies from pdf to pdf also if you are used to ios or android the page turns are not the same like flipping when you tap or perform a page flipit will blink for a sec and refresh the page to move to next page i found this a little annoying but it works if you buy a book online then that might be a better option as it will let you read the formatted content correctlybattery usage is fantasticanother positive is that the inbuilt lights are not glaring in the dark so you will find reading to be a pleasant experience they have settings to adjust brightness as well,3.0
when i tried to hook it up it wouldnt recognize my internet i will have to contact best buy when i get home and have their guys come out to see if they can get it working,3.0
dont last very long,3.0
good gift for basic internet use browsing emails ,3.0
great batteries great price bought several times,5.0
horrible batteries so far every battery we have used hasnt worked,1.0
this tablet is great for teenagers i purchased two for my nephews and they were really happy they immediately began to set it up and download free games they love it,4.0
when i first saw this product it was a must have for me i researched this product for weeks and was happy with what i had read after getting the product home i must say it was over rated this product is not user friendly only  user can register alexa does not have the answers to much i returned it after  days very unsatisfied,2.0

these batteries come very low charged i took new batteries and put them in a computer mouse next day there was a mouse battery is very low its not the first time,1.0
i tried to set it up for over an hour and it wouldnt connect to my wifi the orange ring didnt last more than  sec to even give it a chance it just sat their with the ring of death no matter how quick i was powered my router off and back on even my other devices were connected just fine before and after so frustrated and no matter how hard i tried it didnt work so i just took it back and got a refund totally disappointed,1.0
i would definitely buy it again but it does not have the ambient light sensor like the cheaper voyage does to turn the brightness up and down automatically in the dark or sun for a product of this price it shouldnt be missing any features otherwise it is great light and the text refreshes quickly and is crisp,4.0
there are some things i cant download but good,3.0
i was not satisfied with my purchase but for the price i guess its ok,1.0
it takes a lot of time and subscribing to get the channels i want so i will write another review next year when i got them allhopefully ,2.0
great product easy setup and easy navigation recommended,4.0
i like this tablet its very low maintenance and is easy,4.0
i purchased three of these for family members as christmas gifts on black friday for only  eachpros  price is great responds well to touch and running applications small portable again the price is the best pro to this tabletcons  main homepage runs ads in the background why  apps are only available through the amazon app store making a very limited selection compared to google play and the app store for apple but again this equal to the tax i paid on my ipad air,4.0
i bought this on black friday simply because it was dirt cheap it works ok but kinda slow,2.0
who needs a more expensive tablet when this kindle fire can do just about everything more expensive tablets can do love it use it every day,5.0
kindle oasis is very light with  gb of memory no need for wifi to read,5.0
i got this to replace the ipad for a child i am so disappointed by the charge it dies so quickly and the charger has to be wrapped around the tablet in order for it to charge this was after  weeks of having the tablet low price but not worth the hassle and disappointment,2.0
i am happy so far with this tablet it offers great protection for use with kids but is a little pricey for the lackluster performance great for kids,3.0

i had a kindle once before and decided to try the fire it was at a great price and i love it,5.0
good screen resolution keep wifi off and adjust brightness for best battery life,4.0
weve had three of these kindles they are well built and you cant get the quality in a tablet from any other manufacturer amazon has great support with them,4.0
nothing but problems after a month luckily i could take it back and get a credit for the kindle to put towards an ipad it started off working fine then after a month it started losing internet connection randomly while the old ipad had no problems then it stopped charging never got past  tried different outlets different android chargers nothing worthless,1.0
i wanted to upgrade my kindle fire  first edition this one is really nice graphics are superb as is the speed in loading i dont know yet what else it can do as i havent explored it thoroughly its like a mini lap top and has a camera that takes very clear pictures and has wireless connection to the internet,5.0

for me the kindle black was not a good fit for me there are times i read at night in bed when my husband is sleeping this model doesnt have a back light so im unable to read at night without turning on a light and waking up my husbandso i returned and went for a kindle fire,3.0
it is extremely handy and easy to use the library of books available on amazon is extensive the ability to have a device that can hold hundred of book in the palm of your hand is unparalleled,4.0
so convenient to order these i will be buying my batteries from amazin from now on,5.0
amazonbasics aaa rock,5.0
i bought these thinking great i can save some money well no you wonti have to use batteries in my camera because im too cheap to go buy a new cameraso i bought all these batteries  big boxes usually  batteries last about  hours if i continuously use them take a lot of picslike energizer seriously these batteries last me probably  hours when using them a lot not kiddingi will not repurchase these,2.0
i use this mini tablet at the gym to watch streaming tv and movie shows easy to setup take a bit of time to get used to various screens touch screen is a little slow to respond bluetooth connectivity is not automatic i have to try and connect the same device every time i use the tablet overall very good for the price,3.0
this feels like an affordable tablet while not the best in class it isnt priced to be that either works well happy with purchase,4.0
i love amazonbasics batteries ive been purchasing these batteries of all sizes and they last pretty long,5.0
i bought this and the kids version past christmas its lack power and storage to be useful unless you want to just read books dont waste money on this product the kids version is a good ideal but loading the apps when they work takes forever when they do work the kids enjoy them so i consider it to be a hit and miss ill be canceling the subscription as soon as my free year is up not wasting money on it,1.0
its very good for the price no problems with the product,4.0
batteries are very good but packaging is horrendous which is surprising because usually amazon does a great job with hassle free packaging but every four bats are packaged in tough plastic would have been better to just place the lot of bats in a simple box without the individual plastic wrap will not buy again with this packaging,2.0
theyre cheap but we went through these in less than half the time of the previous pack of the same which was duracell i was hoping the brand wouldnt matter but it seems that in this case it does,2.0
i was a bit worried that i wouldnt like the tablet i had watched the prices go up and down on amazon i wish i had bought one when they were  i also read all of the reviews and watched video reviews i had a trip coming up that i didnt want to take my laptop on and took the plunge i was glad that i did i was able to watch netflix hulu hbo go hbo now and youtube with no problems it is a great tablet for the price i also have some books loaded to read later i have been using my kindle touch for that if you do buy this tablet i would suggest getting a memory card,5.0
i got this because it was much cheaper than the ipad and it supports flash the bonus comes with the ability to binge on my netflix series and listen to music,4.0
easy access to books and the web just annoying ads,4.0
put these aa batteries in smoke detectors and they immediately start the low battery beeps pulled them back out going to see about returning them all  or they will goto recycling ,1.0
love this does exactly what they said it would and more,5.0
i am really happy with my echo so far it has been very easy to use although we havent completely figured out all the functions it was fairly easy to set up,5.0
i got this tablet for my  month old son he constantly wants my phone or ipad to watch youtube kids videos he can work both of these apple devices all on his own i figured he was ready for his own tablet hoping hed leave mine alone no luck the fire is not as userfriendly as my iphone even on the child setting it is not easy to use the surface is not as responsive to touch he gets frustrated with it and puts it down after a few minutes of trying now his daddy uses it and he still goes after my ipad and phone if you want a tablet for your toddler just get an ipad,3.0
i love it from the first moment would love to be more intercative,5.0

i recently purchased this product for my nephew for his birthday he loves it and you can set parental setting to block unwanted content,4.0
dont last nearly as long as major brands,2.0
perfect for somebody who doesnt want to pay for cable or turn their tv into a smart tv,5.0
so i was already not too pleased with amazons choice to only include an essentially useless charger when purchasing a kindle hd and caved to ordering the fast charger so it would not take hours of nonuse to recharge for  you dont even get a full charger just an adapter to put on to the cord they already gave you amazon please just charge the real price for the device instead of settling to slowly rip people off with essential accessories this sort of thing cheapens your image and erodes loyalty,1.0
this product has great sound quality and easy to use i love it and have given it as a gift twice now,5.0
the products that it was delivered but i could not find it anywhere,1.0
finally an affordable name brand tablet with all the bells and whistles amazon has outdone its self with this little gem,5.0
this is way to complicated for kids my kid was frustrated trying to figure it out,2.0
ordered on accident when i had searched for rechargeable batteries not happy i will be less free about ordering on amazon from now on my fault but it made my put up my guard,3.0
this device is slick looking connects to the network easily and if very fast i does the job really well,4.0
my father upgraded from the original kindle fire to this model and hes very happy with it it doesnt compete with more mainstream tablets but he likes the kindles system for downloading library books,3.0
a little disappointed with my first experience with ai you have to learn to communicate with alexa to get results i feel like she should have to learn more about me than i her however i understand she is a gen  and would expect that future versions will closer be to the jetsons than something that keeps telling me i didnt understand what you said i doubt amazon will update the existing units with better technology they will want to you to buy it all over again instead of making a loyal or invested customer happy she does have a lot knowledge you just have to figure how to ask for it or download an additional skillapplication,3.0
they were duds i bought them before christmas so i could stick them in the toys and not one worked i tried them on other items to make sure it wasnt the toys and not the batteries  nope  it was all of the batteries i only give one star for the reason i got them on time now i have a box of triple a batteries that dont work  so glad i caught that before christmas or i would have had disappointed children on christmas,1.0

no worries with this tablet its easy to work and has all the functionality of the big boys,4.0
i baught  for my kids and figured that with the cover the the one year of freetime which includes all the videos apps and games then it makes sense i baught this one as a gift for a kid overseas and all the content is not playing when i contacted amazon they said its not for overseas although i asked in best buy before i buy it and they assured me it works everywhere its totally overpriced for a tablet that doesnt play anything best buy should know and let customers know specially when u ask specifically,1.0
i returned this to the store cuz i realised i didnt need music or lighting control i replaced it with the echo dot disappointed because didnt know i needed wifi which i dont have,2.0
nice tablet for children  works well as a gift for the price,2.0

i bought this expecting the same quality i have received in the previous  kindles i purchased i am disappointed i like the price the home screen is just all the apps right in your face not just the ones you want like in the older version kindle fire i mostly use it for reading books and so far im dissatisfied its great to swipe to the next page but when i want to go to settings or something else while reading i find it difficult to open instead the page just turns and by the time i finally get to the book settings ive lost my spot i downloaded the facebook app and its very slow maybe its amazons way of telling me thats what i get for  but come on sometimes i like to use the kindle to search the web and that too is slow i compared it to my older version and there is a noticible difference in speed i know there are other cool user tools but for me i mostly use it to read and check facebook and maybe pinterest its priced well if you want it for kids its user friendly and my kids have already figured out all the options i would recommend it for kids or for people who are technologically not savvy,3.0

amazon seems to have changed the manufacturer of this battery i liked it very much the last year but the new one has a different look has noticeably lower capacity and leaks batteries usually leak after they die but these leaked while they were still good and apparently died because of the leak all of my devices have battery monitored one day they were good with  power left and they died suddenly the next day the leaks were mostly minor but clearly noticeable from body discolorationone thing that has not changed from before is the packaging and it is still bad they are shrinkwrapped  in a package and they are hard to open as there is no cutout or pulltab to break the wrap it is difficult to break open by hand twisting the package causes undue stress to the batteries and that may be cause of the leak i have had to use scissors or knife to cut open the package,2.0

found out after having had opened and tried programming this awesome alexa that basically nothing comes with it its a listening device in my home that wont do anything unless i pay more into amazon the fact that i synced my pandora account is pointless because i have to spell out what i want alexa to play by saying alexa play x station from my pandora play list how is the rest of my family suppose to know what to request when i am the only one who knows my pandora play list and barely at that i have many complaints and basically disappointed in my purchase i was lead to believe this was the radio of the future it is if i pay for the amazon music unlimited monthly,1.0

i have owned the product for about a month and it is as advertised the case only opens about a third of the way i have always had computer bags that opened fully it it inconvenient to have to wrestle with the laptop trying to fit it through the small opening i recommend spending few extra shekels and buy a case that fully opens,3.0

for a device with k technology they dont seem to advertise it much you can barely see it on the box also search feature only works for amazon thats a waste of a search feature remote disconnects from the box often and your have to take the batteries out of the remote to reset it i would not recommend until amazon fixes the bugs,2.0

i have both the echo and the tap they are spectacular,5.0
last less than a quarter as long as even offbrand batteries such as rayovac creating a lot more waste with name brand batteries my wireless keyboard would last almost a year these amazon branded batteries last only  months if they werent considered hazardous waste when spent i might have given them  stars on account of there low price but when you consider how hard it is to dispose of batteries properly and how much time youll spend changing them out of your favorite devices theyre really not worth your time,1.0

update ive been trying to use up the last of the batteries and two more have been found leaking acid since the previous review i didnt want to just throw them out but at this point is isnt worth the mess and damage to devicesoriginal reviewbought two packs of these on subscribe and save in the last couple months we play laser tag and the guns require  batteries each so i thought this would be a good source of cheap batteries for our  guns i put these in about a week ago after having the batteries sitting on a shelf for a couple months we played a game and then put the guns up the next time we played  about  days later i noticed an oily liquid running out of one of the guns the battery was leaking acid and it had run out of the battery compartment and was all over the outsidei get that it happens to other batteries as well but thats usually after sitting in a device for months not a few days i would not trust these in anything expensiveand take them out immediately after use i wont buy again sorry no picsi was busy cleaning up the mess,1.0

silk is painfully slow and doesnt work on many websites had to install mozilla to use bestbuycom ironically i cant put in orders with silk the default fire browser if using silk make sure to disable the caching to amazons servers with caching on the browser is almost unusableads are really annoying only come on when you first turn it on but i dont even really notice what they are usually things id never purchase like makeup im a guy or other junk these make decent devices for the kids for playing games on too this is not a quality device like a galaxy tab but for the price its good enough because you know theyre going to break it at some point,3.0
very easy to install and use great for testing whole family the remote is easy to use and very easy to memorize,4.0
picture quality seemed grainy we tried streaming video on amazon prime with it and it buffered some times even though we have an extremely fast wifi for the price though its not bad we use it for our kids apps,3.0
the item was on sale over the christmas period at a great price took it home and when i charged it up the back of the tablet became very hot to the touch and the battery life reduced dramatically left it alone tried it again this time no issues four days later it did the same thing when i was charging it up again sent it back for a refund,1.0

the fire tablet is such a great value if money is no consideration there are better tablets out there but for the money this is a great choice especially if youre a prime member,5.0
one of the best deals on batteries ive ever gotten i feel like they are just about as good as duracell or energizer but for this price you cant deny the value ill be buying amazon batteries in bulk like this from now on its close enough to the major brands for me to switch and enjoy the value,4.0
great servive best buy and the price match is great i used it both at best buy,1.0
have owned ios products as long as i can remember not on same level,1.0
it was a bit more involved getting set up but thereafter the function is simply talking to alexia the plug adapter to turn on and off lights tv is useful and certainly worth having,2.0

every time i open my amazon fire games pop up it is very annoying i have no interest in games i do not play them i did not purchase the item for games i purchased my fire for reading books but it is very difficult to get to books i go through a number of minutes and still do not accomplish the task that i want to do i would like to know how to take off the games so i can do what i want to do,1.0
shortest life batteries ever waste of money,1.0

i thought that this was a great deal but the batteries dont seem to last very long i feel like i am constantly having to change the batteries in my remote i would equate these to being a little bit better than dollar store batteries but they are not of the highest quality,2.0

use this to watch netflix instead of my phone much larger screen size and battery life is good,4.0
i brought this as one of the wished for items for our adoptafamily it appeared to be a nice device for viewing email social media and entertainment,4.0
the price is good but they battery life is much lower than other alkaline batteries we use i get approx half the life from these batteries  compared to walmart rayovacs,2.0

have wanted some type of kindle for quite a while especially for reading the many free nonfiction history books ive downloaded for my genealological research couldnt pass up the sale price on this model and it is everything i hoped for,5.0
the fire itself works well so far the ouch comes from the fact that the buyers amazon account must be hitched to it to download free games who wants kids downloading anything that has your credit card attached even if its free or accessing your account,3.0

this product has surpassed all of my expectations for these add on tv devices i originally had a roku and i have to say this is  times better you wont regret purchasing it,5.0
awesome product fell in love with it the minute i turned it on,5.0
okay so i have been debating for days on whether to rate this thing  or  stars and i still want to rate it  and a half but i have settled for  stars here is whyprosthe only real reason i wanted this case over the others is because every other case holds the kindle in with straps around the edges and this is the only case that holds the kindle in while letting you see the whole front side it holds it in perfectly neither feeling loose or too tight to get it out the black leather is genuine leather and smells nice and while the front cover is very thin if you tap on it you get a hollow drum sound and it can be bent without much effort it takes mild amounts of abuse without a problem also the flap folds back perfectly and when you are reading you hardly notice the kindle has a case onconsmy main complaint is the quality of the leather if you compare this to the case for the kindle  keyboard the leather is a little thinner but much less durable i sometimes lightly hold my kindle between my teeth when i run out of hands and after a week i can still see my tooth marks whereas on the k case i couldnt also even a mild scratch will either take several days to disappear update most scratches will mostly disappear so its not as big a problem as i originally thoughtthe only other complaint is of course the lack of anything to hold the cover closed but this has actually not been much of a problem for me quite often i like to frisbee toss my kindle onto a nearby soft surface like carpet or a pillow or bed and i was afraid the cover would flap open every time but  times out of the  i tried it stayed shut just fineread more,4.0
i got it because a frend that really lime it i had apple tv and still think is better than this,3.0
would give it a  star if the battery lasted as long as they claim but its worth the extra charging times for the nice design so light and easy in your hand especially without the cover but using the cover is comfortable as well the leather cover smells a bit when it arrives but i let it air out for a few days before using it and now its fine nice quality leather and i love the merlot color the page turn buttons are easier to use than the buttons on the voyage screen looks the same even though they claim there are more backlights on this one im very happy with my oasis,4.0
loved the price but i found myself replacing them more quickly in items like the wall clocks and the remote controls i like having a box of replacement batteries on hand in the house so these are fine for emergencies but i might want to invest in a brand that lasts a bit longer for things like smoke detectors or flashlights,3.0
the tablet is easy to access and it was affordable,4.0
zipper on front kept coming apart since this opens to the base of the backpack i almost lost an item double check this when you get it give it a few solid tugs,3.0
good tablet for a young person to begin with small to handle,3.0
very little capacity they last only about  as long when compared with other main stream batteries,1.0
price was too high so we found out customer service at best buy in north myrtle beach had very little patience with our questions not enough questions answered we later found out that this too is best buy policy,2.0

i do not find this as easy to use as my original kindle fire but i do like the camera a lot better though it is not clear megapixels,3.0

last got fire  for my kids with an amazon freetime subscription these are very good for the price with two flaws the screen is good and much better than other android devices at  but not great and got the  mb version with i would not recommend in hindsight because androids subpar management on sd cards got these this year it has a much better screen not only larger but with better resolution adequate speakers for its price its fast enough and overall more enjoyable to use  gb is the minimum id recommend even with sd cards because some apps just work better with internal storage and some apps even stored in sd will still use some amount of internal storageit also has alexa voice supportthe main reason for these tablets in my case is the freetime subscription that has unlimited access to thousands of ageappropriate books hundreds or thousand of free apps and heavily curved web access per age presets amazon fire os has a decent support for multiuser and in particular kids accounts my kids are  and  they spend a lot of time on games as expected but also read a good amount of books,5.0
bought five of these for my teachers to take photosvideos and upload to our site and email parents does everything just fine except the cameras arent the greatest pretty slow to capture the pic and they all come out blurry with he slightest amount of motion from the subject or photograher ok product if your not focused on taking pictures,3.0

this kindle is awesome i love the design of it nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way its designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read the only reason i didnt give it five stars was because of the price if it were cheaper this kindle would have been five stars no doubt,4.0

omg these batteries are so affordable and it may just be my biased opinion but they seem to last longer than the duracell or energizer batteries i buy at the store maybe because they dont sit in inventory for goodness know how long regardless these are my favorite aas,5.0
bought it for my yr ild daughter and its good for kids a little different from a regular android tablet layout has alot going on but can get used to it,4.0
the portability is nice but misses key elements from the other twosound is good but this unit does not allow for the new peak in feature or allow you to add this speaker to play music all thru the house ,2.0
for some reason these just havent held a charge the way the duracells ive used the past do ive used these in those smallwiredled lights you can use for decorations those lights take  aa batteries and while the old duracells ive used lasted several months on a hour on  houroff timer these are lasting just a few weeks,2.0
works well enough but is outstanding for the price just be wary of the operating system you could poetically download an android emulator that would make this a  instantly,3.0
alexa is ok for basic weather and turning onoff a light you have linked on your network she still has some issues understanding basic commands and i would love to see skills from major airlines that allow you to check flights before you drive to the airport the music sound quality is good and you have to be an amazon prime member to really see value there hopefully in a year it will turn out to be a good investment,3.0
both packs were useless confirmed low charge with multimeter,1.0
ive usually had very good experiences buying amazonbasics branded items ive found them to very comparable to the top brand names these batteries are the exception quality wise they are more comparable to rayovac batteries than duracell or energizer,2.0
these things do not last very long either in the product they are powering or on the shelf the ones we had on our shelf were not even good to use after  months of sitting,2.0
the only reason i gave it a  is because of the inability to download directly from the google play store otherwise good image and quick response,4.0
i have used these batteries in several items from flashlights to toys i have found them less than adaquate for the items they were used in in my flashlights i have found they last with average use about  weeks not very good for controllers like tv remotes they last less than a month they may be cheper in the short run but they become much more expensive in the long run i will not buy them again and suggest paying a bit more and getting the name brand batteries,2.0
i gave the amazon echo as a gift to my children for the holidays and from what i understand they are all loving it,4.0

if you are looking for something to help you keep more organized or keep you up to date with weather markets and the latest news the amazon echo show is what you are looking for honestly the product is top of the line technology and is easy to use as long you are patient and work with it and read the directions the size of it is truly perfect it honestly reminds me of the size of normal alarm clock that would have on a nightstand and with that it truly can serve that purpose it also has a touch screen and i feel it is very durable and can stand to last the sound quality is also superb with dual inch speakers it has bluetooth capabilities as well but it only works with android samsung fire os ios device excluding mac products the echo show comes in two colors black and white the product has many different features and functions and they can accommodate pretty much anyoneäôs needs the top feature is the alexa app which is an application in which you can call commands and ask it questions about most anything then i believe the music capabilities are truly amazing and how you can ask it to play almost any song or playlist whenever you want also you can tell it to volume up or down as well another new modernized technology it has is the capability to do hands free voice command smart home options a couple things that could be improved is sometimes that it does not fully hear your exact words and it will search for something you arenäôt expecting the other function it could have is it could have single voice recognition to only several voices so then you donäôt have the entire room trying to mess with it constantly the price is also fair as well for its creative capabilities it has so if you are trying to find some new technology to add to your home the echo show would be a great addition for you,4.0
decent speed and a nice screen make this a great device for the money i find myself using it more and more,5.0

very competitive price  unit works well we like color and size,4.0
pro relatively inexpensive although i did end up waiting almost two weeks for deliverycons high dropout rate they come in packs of four when used in nikon cameras its not uncommon to find after an hour of use that three of the cells have dropped to v while the fourth has dropped tov they come out of the box within a hundredth of a volt of each other so im guessing that either the electrochemistry is highly variable from cell to cell or theres a interesting failure mode under load,3.0
i bought this tablet for my mother  as a christmas gift which i gave to her on the day  just this week  she called to tell me that the tablet was not working right i went to see her and check it out sure enough it wasnt functioning properly im hoping that when i take it in it will be replaced without a problem i know sometimes items are just defective thats why i would recommend this item ive had my kindle fire for  years now with never a problem,1.0

reception and wi fi interface is outstanding much better than roku,5.0
its a good tablet screen is kind of weird but it does its job i wish the it had more memory but for the price i cant expect to much for a inexpensive tablet but what i do love is that all the apps are free so thats a score great for kids,3.0

this tablet conked out on me the first day i powered it on the amazon symbol came up and never went past that screen i was highly annoyed because i purchased it as a first to send it out of the country my biggest mistake was trusting that everything would work fine instead i shouldve powered on the device to ensure everything was fine,2.0

i really wanted to love the amazon aa batteries but they just are not durable enough for my usage as a night time long distance runner i have led headlamps with a rear red flashing light that i use which require  aa batteriesi usually purchase duracell or energizer batteries in bulk and they have worked well rechargeable batteries are not very good in led headlamps so those are outthe problem with the amazon batteries is that i get about  or  hours of strong light then it really fades fast the longest i have used the amazon batteries is  hours and by then the light is less than  brightness the other issue i noticed with these batteries is that the front headlight will lightly flash in time with the rear light once the front brightness is reduced when i test the batteries with a tester they are only  way through the green rangeduracell and energizers give me nearly    hours at full brightness and maybe  or  hours with  i have not seen the light flashing when the brightness drops on the these batteries when i test the batteries after the light is reduced they are in the yellow or red areathe amazon batteries give me two less than the energizers and duracells which is significant i average  night time runs with the duracells and energizers and  sometimes  with amazon batteriesthese may be perfect in remote controls and other static use devices but if it has to drive a light or a motor you may want to skip thesethe light pictures show new  and  hoursthe nd light shows new and  hoursthe battery tester shows new   and  hours,3.0

the amazon echo was easy to setup straight out of the box and my family began using it immediately we are learning new things it can do every week the sound quality is amazing and this has become the primary music source for my house when purchasing i would have preferred a black echo but white is all this best buy had at the time before xmas but white looks very clean on our kitchen counter where it sits there are some words alexa is still struggling with understanding but we do have a bit of a texas drawl so i think were getting used to each other,4.0

amazon fire is a good tablet if you like ebooks its also nice to get a sixmonth subscription to the washington post their claim to have  gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you  and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage another problem is that you cant flag something as being inappropriate like you can on samsung galaxy tablets,2.0

i bought this when it was on sale and my rewards coupon was expiring so i felt i didnt have much to lose overall this tablet is a good value but you have to be careful about certain aspectsthe tablet is really fast for something in this price range the screen has pretty good resolution as well there is no bluetooth connectivity so keyboards and wireless headphones wont work with itthe app store is the amazon app store i side loaded google play and am getting my apps from there youtube helpful for instructions the lock screen is an amazon billboard the default search is bing instead of google i havent figured out how to fix that yet i just use the google app to search google you can load the chromecast app from play but it is hit or miss as to whether it works it works for youtube and flixter but it doesnt work for any disney apps watch espn watch abc etc you can cast the screen and view things that way but the resolution is limited to the resolution of the tablets screeni think it was a good deal since it was cheap and i can now watch my prime movies on it still its not the tablet you would expect from an android device my satisfaction would improve greatly if chromecast worked better,3.0

ive always been a fan of the kindle ever since the first one came out over a decade againi was excited about this kindle due to the many premium features it showed  the allmetal finish highresolution epaper display backlighting extended battery life etci was significantly disappointed to see that amazon pushes ads through the kindle when you put it into sleep mode and throughout the store options additionally i was further frustrated by the fact that i learned there was a cellular version available direct from amazon but not through the store for such an expensive unit to have ads with no option to disable them seems unreasonable and like a ripoff additionally the fact that this only supports wifi not cellular or whispersync makes it even more of a drawback and something i would not recommend to a friend  stick with the cheaper versioni also found annoying problems trying to get my apple airpod earphones to work with this device pairing took forever to finish or work had to try three different times and if the unit sits for too long i found that i had to go through the entire pairing process again they were not automatically connected and synced the moment i had both devices turned on,2.0

bought these because i had heard from several sources that alkaline batteries are one of those items that you can buy as generics and get comparable quality to name brands it is not unusual for me to keep batteries in storage for more than a year without a problem with leakage these after a year would begin leaking soon after installing them that is they come out of their protective wrap looking brand new but would leak within days they fouled up a few things one of which was a good work flashlight i hadnt seen a battery leak in decades i had to throw out the remaining ones even though they looked deceptively good,1.0

i am on my rd kindle this software downloads new purchases with a picture of the cover of the book on my homepage only about a fifth of the available space so this would only allow you to buy at most four books at a time before the covers would be too small the new books should be downloaded to my library in list form as in the original kindle in addition once you have looked at a book in the homepage it disappears and you have to search for it or place it in a category finally this system disallows you from manipulating books the way you want this os is definitely not user friendly it requires a great deal of effort of the user a lot of wasted data space and waste of time i am requesting a return to the original kindle os,2.0

theyre the same size as the batteries they replaced who knows if they last longer have more power than others until they go dead who remembers to come back and post that these batteries worked for one day more or less than the last set you had theyre batteries and they looked like they were cheap to me if they melt a remote control or something ill try to remember to come back and letchall know,3.0
great product a good product for the price great battery life,5.0
i waited a couple months to review giving amazon time to make this product equal to the sony dash from nearly a decade ago it isnt the screen provides nothing of value and you cant turn of amazon tips you have near zero customization cant even move the clock to the other side of the screen and something that a sony dash did nearly  years ago pandora or prime music as an alarm seriously this is the biggest fail run away from this half baked amazon disaster,1.0
these might be ok for remote controls and wall clocks that dont take much power but dont expect to use them in you digital camera the low battery warning comes on the instant i turned on my canon is point and shoot camera with afresh pair of these batteries within about  minutes the camera dies and wont restart without another fresh set of batteries,2.0

i love the size of this its the size of a book the only thing i dont like is the lock screen has ads,4.0
one of the important reasons i purchased this was for hbo go app which they have but does not work with chartercomcast a quite large market of people affected so a useless claim they readily put out there that you can play it what else can you not use it for i havent found yet but amazon has not written me back after i emailed them about this issue im stuck with waste of money and will go get a google chrome now,1.0
i bought this fire tv  months ago one day out of the blue it stopped working power is on but as soon after i see the amazon logo the screen goes black i google the problem and it seems that the only way to reset it to the factory mode is by the on screen menu so there is no way for me to do it i just emailed the company and waiting for a response since it is unacceptable that this thing only lasted  months before it became useless not a happy camper here,1.0
the kindle fire was a perfect gift for my wife she has not been a big fan of newer electronics in general and needed something compact affordable and very easy to use,4.0
the tablet is okay i mean it does the job however the wifi is really spotty we even changed the wifi password based on a youtube video to ensure that it worksbut it keeps going in and out,3.0
i bought these for remotes in my home im constantly having to change them and sometimes the brand new batteries dont work,2.0
i have to say it was a little confusing and frustrating when i was not getting the verification code from amazon  i waited for  minutes then i requested another code nothing then a nother one and still nothing  i started to set up the device at  am and by  am i was fed up with it i had to step away after about  hours we went shopping and at the mall i recieved about  codes from amazon ,2.0
got this for my children and grandchildren to give my mom she thinks she needs an electronic device like all the kids have so this was perfect she can play games and have email and the kids help her with books and videos perfect for grandma,5.0
i bought this after hearing the sound quality of the speakers at my friends house i also wanted something voice activated in the kitchen to keep handsfree the sound quality is good the noise cancelling mics are great at moderate volume only downside is no battery operation it must always be plugged in also even though it has bluetooth and can be paired to a smartphone you cannot use the echo to pass through phone calls only music for iot toys its fun for voice control ex nest etc the skills are mostly cheesy though fun toy that allows easy access to prime music pandora etc,4.0
force update when turned it on for the first time have to wait for an hour with nothing to do on the tablet really bad user experience,3.0

it is not an ipad but for  it is a good tablet really good for reading,4.0
its a nice idea if you have a need for such a gadget my opinion was it wasnt worth the money computers and smart phones do mostly the same thing so why have an additional gadget it might be more worthwhile for someone that wants to use it for running smart gadgets around the house not for me so i returned it,2.0
enjoy using but sometimes alexa struggles with answering questions nice to have not a must have definitely room for improvement,4.0
bought this to replace my aging nexus   version but didnt hold a candle up to it i knew it going in but wanted to see for myself in person for  cant hardly beat the features but i was spoiled by arguably the best small android tablet ever made i knew the screen resolution was lacking especially on an  screen but coming from the nexus it was a huge difference also even at  plus years old the processor was humming along smoothly the extra  gb ram was also helpful anyways back to the fire hd  one advantage it had over the nexus was the expansion slot i loved being able to put my media on it but then again the media displayed on the screen was subpar so its a wash i installed google play on it so that it expanded its functionality and im an avid amazon conneseiur but found the table too limiting ultimately returned and bought an old discontinued fire hd  for  the resolution almost matches that of the nexus so im happy for now,3.0
does what it is suppose to do  power adaptor  chargerthree stars because its overpriced,3.0
the only problem that i had is that it should have been included with the kindle paperwhite there is no way to charge the paperwhite unless you buy the charger the charging port on the paperwhite is so small that nothing that i already have will work kindle does not even provide a usb cable so that you can charge from your computer the outlet plug is cheep plastic hollow and will probably break no warranty,2.0

product ok,2.0
understands all the different accents and you have all the info ready and available alway,4.0
if you like to read and like to have more than one option then an ereader is something to consider i like the screen when reader as it is not glaring like a tablet or computer screen the ability to adjust the font size is very beneficial for me i also like being able to highlight words and get their definition i am not a fan of all of the controls but once you get use to them the kindle is very useful i wish i could convert pdfs to the kindle format a little better but that is not a fault of the device,4.0
replacement for broken screen tablet on grandsons tablethes happy,3.0
in my personal opinion this product would be unable to satisify any adult whether it was for business or pleasure limited apps limited space slow uploading etc also due to this being an amazon product many apps and options are unavailable that are commonly used with both android and apple products so i would not recommend to anyone,2.0

had to replace my sons lenovo android tablet and at the same time renew the warranty had a few options of brands to choose for the replacement lots of family suggested the amazon even the best buy staff said it was the better choice not to mention the cheapest of the four brands to pick from well set up was a disaster i wasnt aware that this tablet lets you put up to four names under one amazon account until after the initial account member name was completed so now my  yr old has an amazon account also didnt lime that i had to put in credit info for set up and then had to go into settings to put a parental block on inapp purchases too many ad pop ups and thats just while it is turning on in not happy with this tablet  it automatically backs up photos and stuff to an icloud i dont know what that is  how to access it nor is there an icon on the screen for it also lots of unnecessary pages and icons all over the screen that cant be changed my other sons tablet is in need of replacement and warranty renewal i will not be replacing his with this product,1.0

i have owned a few tablets and currently own an ipad and iphone im invested in the amazon ecosystem via kindle ereaders and fire tvs this tablet is incredibly affordable and offers acceptable performance but its heavily restricted if you do not figure out how to install the google play store as the amazon app store is missing a huge number of every day apps its a great extension for fire tvs and its certainly a good choice as a primary tablet for kids or parents who dont have an apple budget personally i still find myself reaching for the ipad,3.0

to spite the fact that i have nothing but good things to say about amazon and anthing ive ever gotten from them and that i love my fire i find it greedy that the wall charger doesnt come with the kindle not everyone ok most people but still not everyone has a usb port to plug into im taking my charger back i think amazon should make things right and let anyone who purchased a kindle without a charger have one for free or credit those who had to buy one,1.0
this tablet is great for small kids because it is well protected and is preloaded with many gamesadults can also use it when requiredyou have to be careful what mode your in as your child may start trying to buy stuff on you,4.0
the echo was so good i ended up getting the echo show as well at first it was a device that i enjoyed using for various reasons one being that i could ask alexa to watch any youtube videos i wanted to watch then one day i asked alexa to play a video and she responded by sayinggoogle is not supported on echo show until youtube comes back as a skill the echo show probably isnt worth the extra money id say stick with the echo if you have amazon music or spotify or the echo dot if you only use the echo as part of your smart home,3.0
only reason i was not able to rate this five of five is that the app m cloud library is not yet compatible so getting books from the library requires an older app which does not work as well,4.0

breaks down too fast and wont run my trail camera but around  hours,2.0
i would like to rate this  and half stars  while the adapter itself works just fine i think it is underhanded of amazon to make you pay extra for it maybe i am not technologically uptodate but it seems to me that most people charge things at a wall socket not with a computer usb port i think that i read that charging with usb takes longer as well just like an airline charging you for taking your bags on the plane now amazon is charging you for things you need to make the kindle work  pretty soon youll have to pay for the cord guides and updates not very good customer service ,3.0

alexa may be new but i would have thought some of the simple commands she would have been able to respond to already for the amount amazon charges it should come with better instructions including what specifically to download into ones device iphone etc so as to make some apps ready to go amazon dropped the ball on this one,3.0
if its possible to have gotten a dud batch i sure got it we blew through all these batteries in less than a month my kids toys arent that super powered and even in remotes i was having to change batteries way too often for example the magic touch counting toy the store batteries lasted  years popped in some amazon batteries  month and the second child didnt play with it nearly as much as the first for the price it was worth the try but im going back to the other brands,2.0
i ordered two of these tablets one for  yr old and another for mom it is not user friendly difficult to use and full of advertisements even when not online comes with games that kids enjoy but very limited on other application options book ordering requires monthly subscriptions we have purchased another product for mom and the  yr old quickly got bored with the limited options and i got frustrated trying to navigate,1.0

if youre looking for something to keep your laptop cool this will do the trick although only bad things are it isnt comfortable sitting on your lap as the metal just isnt awesome the rivets where you rest your hands are welded things and theyre uncomfortable as they dig into your hands when trying to type or even resting your hands wouldnt recommend,3.0
the camera is not very sharp  and you can not download another one ,3.0

bought this for my young son because of the warranty you are required to have a credit card stored in the account and to turn on parental controls it blocks other features too like alexa this is the most ridiculous setup ever,1.0
giving it an average rating because boo hoo i havent figured out how to make it work yet it responds but doesnt seem to have answers to any of my queries or requests it must be just a matter of connecting it to a proper wireless source so far i havent figured it out i am eager to however i guess i am just too technologically challenged,3.0

the media player is compact and low profile the remote is nice the unitremote freeze up quite often requiring the player to be unplugged to reset it this may be due to the fact i am running kodi i do have a first generation firestick with kodi that does not freeze up like this unit the performance differences between the firestck and this unit are negligible in my opinion,3.0
had to spend  hours on line to make it work on line,3.0

the echo is everything i thought it would be easy to set up easy to use loud and many extra features you can link with the timer and grocery list features are awesome voice commands for pandora are cool as well,4.0
the paperwhite is certainly better than the regular kindle primarily due to the back lighting feature if you buy a kindle ereader this would be the one to buy you could spend more for the higher end models but theres really no need the main issue with this ereader is the smudge effect at the bottom of the screen i tried two paperwhites and both had the same issue perhaps this is just how they are,3.0
despite what seems to be a great deal for a pack of aa batteries these arent great  stars only because of the deal as theyre for light use i use them only for my xbox controllers i understand that the life is different with gaming sucking up all the energy but ive put a pair in before and about  weeks later had to change them not to mention i have  controllers one has a grip so i switch between them often this means they should last longer since im not just draining the battery life on one of them overall not great for gaming or heavy use otherwise theyre nice backups ill have to compare these to say duracell but from past experience i dont remember having to change them so often,2.0
this item is useless to play music through voice recognition unless you pay for an amazon prime or amazon music account once that is disconnected she only plays your music through manual control from a blue tooth connection from your phone pointless more than half the questions i ask her she doesnt know the answers to the only thing shes good for so far is the time and weather that basically the most expensive blue tooth speaker and clock i have ever purchased i want my money back,1.0

i had the first generation firetv and it was great i wanted something that was a little faster for playing games and also for using with plex plex works so much better on this generation than the first more of the videos that i have can be played direct instead of being transcoded games also seem much smoother on this device than the first generation but it is hard to tell due to the limited types of games on the amazon app store if you are looking for a device that can stream netflix hulu hbo go amazon prime video and espn and still be used for casual gaming then this is the device for you,4.0

i was skeptical at first of these batteries because they were so much cheaper then most but we have been using them exclusively for several months and they last just as long as other name brands,5.0
in my opinion these did not last anywhere near as long as duracel in things like led candles which is crazy and trail cameras cameras were not exposed to cold temps more or less than other batteries we buy in bulk for the north house amazon basics is great for things like sheets and beeding and towels in my opinion the battery life in the large package of aaa and aa size we purchased were lacking,2.0
at least half of this batch had no charge or at least so little that they died within an hour of being put in a walkietalkie very disappointed,2.0
work great,5.0
i like the flexibility and great responsiveness of the firetv our family is able take advantage of the built in options including amazon prime and set it up just the way i like i also have friends who prefer the fire stick they have customized those and still have good performance firetv is great for anyone and even better if you are a little tech savvy,4.0

these are the worst batteries i have ever encountered anywhere in my year life i am appalled that amazon put their name on them i guarantee that if these had been my first amazon purchase i would never have done business here again if they had not been wrapped in packs of  batteries in cellophane i would have been certain that someone else had used them all up and then returned these batteries to amazonnone of the batteries was anywhere close to full power  they couldnt provide adequate power to anything i tried them in for any batterypowered item to work properly candles and flashlights were so dim i would have required more of them than i am physically capable of carrying to avoid tripping over my own feet none of the appliance remotes would even turn their respective appliances on after these batteries were inserted every item i tried these batteries in also stopped working completely due to a dead battery in less than  minutesobviously i should have returned these batteries and im sure i would have done so if my mom had not had a heart attack shortly after i received them i am just grateful she is now doing so well that neither she nor her cardiac surgeon have to rely on any batterypowered device,1.0

not the best case amazon has ever put out i have a number of other amazon brand kindle and kindle fire cases for my various kindle devices and this is the least effective of the bunch it doesnt stand in any position so i cant use my  hands free it also doesnt line up properly when closed so the fire seems to come out of sleep mode thus draining the battery more quickly and finally i have discovered that i do prefer the leather covers over whatever material this is made from i understand that the cost of a leather case would probably be half the cost of the kindle fire hd not that this case was any bargain at ,2.0

i was attracted by the price of the base kindle but in the end opted for the paperwhite as it was illuminated and had rounded edges which felt more comfortable definitely worth the extra few dollars in my opinion my local library offers free loans of ebooks which i have been taking advantage of there are also many free books online  samples and classics with expired copyrights battery life is good and the device is lightweight even in bright ambient light you get minimal screen glare i prefer this to a physical book which i never expected,4.0

the sound quality of the speaker in my opinion is not worth the extra cost versus a echo dot i could spend the difference on a separate speaker to use with the dot and also have the flexibility of using that speaker elsewhere,1.0
the device is one of the best especially if you are an amazon prime subscriber the amazon prime music on the firetv is the best music streaming device the only issue i had is that the remote controler stopped working and i had to use the firetv app on my phone to control the device,5.0

these arent the greatest batteries but they work weve found that they work best in computer accessories like a keyboard or mouse but do not last long in things like toy remote controlled cars anything that takes a big drain in short bursts off of them like electric toy car motors shortens the life of these batteries fast but things that only use a small amount of energy over a long period of time do a lot better some name brand batteries do very well with high drain electronics and last a lot longer than these but if you use these amazon batteries on low draw electronics youll get your moneys worthwhat ive found them good for keyboard mouse laser pointer small led flashlights small noise making toys plays music electronic beepsnot good for anything with an electric motor toy cars pencil sharpener etcthey can be a good value depending on what you use them to power,4.0

i purchased the new kindle tablet not really knowing what to expecti didnt read any reviews before hand nor did i try the one in store after getting home charging and applying updates i noticed there are numerous brightstuck pixels at least  its only noticeable on dark screens i understand the devices limitations verses price but you would expect to at least have a functional screen with maybe  pixel issue at mostas i mentioned above when you plug it in and turn it on it immediately starts an update that process took a good thirty minutes to complete upon first boot i went to register with my amazon account but it returned some funky error message i tried again and it said the device was already registered so i was unable to complete the setupwalk through im a very technical user so this wasnt too big of an issue but i could see where it could be for someone that isnt savvy with computerstabletsall that said in use it runs decently and def better then you would expect a tablet at this price point to run its not a power house perse but for what its built for consumption device it does everything from play movies music and casual games with out a hitch the ui is realitivley snappy as wellpros price ips screen viewable at most angles works well with the amazon eco systemcons mono sound  speaker poorly placed on back of unit stuck pixels out of the box low resolution device registration issuesin closing i would recommend to friends as long as they understand its limitations,3.0

the amazon echo tap is a nice  interesting devicebut it did not fit my needs i also have the amazon echo and absolutely love it so whats the difference a you have to walk up the the tap to touch it  this is not as convenient and not as fun as the talking to the echo from across the room b the audio quality not very good  more like a small bluetooth speaker c the tap is fine around the house when its connected to the home wifi but when you are out of the house it must connect to your cell phone or other wifi that is not going to work very well,3.0
everything i had read was a bit confusing on how the echo can control it but low and behold it has the alexa service built into it the echo cannot control the amazon fire tv which was the sole reason i bought it well also in hopes that hbo now would have surround sound on it but of course it didnt so theyre both at fault here and the reason why i returned it immediately since neither of the above worked this made the device completely redundant with my chromecast,1.0

were an unplugged family  multiple devices kindles ipads roku etc  so were pretty familiar with this sort of tech fire tv works okay but the remote has started giving me problems and weve only had the product for about  months our roku  which weve had for over a year is much smoother and hasnt given us any problems we also use a chromecast which also seems to be less quirky than the firetv i have a ps in the same room as the firetv and i find myself going to the ps when the firetv starts to annoy unless youre looking for a device that can also run kodi id strongly recommend the roku  over the firetv,3.0

this is an average performance tablet and amazon centric this tablet could have been better if amazon would have made it with android os instead of poorly designed fire os the app store and apps in that are not great this tablet can be good for people who wants to read while travel or play some games while travel will be good i paid only  so cant complain for the price i paid i already have ipad mini  and comparing with that makes this tablet little slow,3.0
i came here to look at the one and two star reviews and see that people are saying the same thing ive been thinking since trying to use my first shipment of these batteries which are supposed to be better than the previous version that they replaced ive used  of these batteries so far and each one has barely lasted  weeks in my mouse the previous version usually lasted a couple months at least it seems like in this day and age its rare that when things are supposedly improved upon that theyre actually better i can only guess that amazon found a cheaper supplier for their branded batteries i guess its time to cancel my subscribe and save subscription since im not the only one who finds these batteries to be subpar to their predecessors if the rest of the batteries in this pack perform better ill update my review to reflect thatedited to add on  now that the th battery from this pack lasted just over  weeks in my mouse i will be contacting amazon customer service as i mentioned previously the older version of these batteries worked so well that i have to wonder why they changed them i see the larger size amazon batteries still carry the older name,1.0
initially i purchased this solely for the purchase of controlling lutron lights however after being  a friends house for a bbq and watching them use this for music i decided to give it a try to see if it could replace my sonosit cant however ive found that im much more likely to play spotify through this using voice controls if im in and out of a room for a shorter period of time and not near a sonos to hit playtoo busy to pull the phone out for sonos app this thing has also become more powerful as more iot devices and services integrate with echo or ifttt there is a tremendous amount of potential give it a try and spend at least a week getting to know alexa you wont be sorry,4.0
these are solid batteries and last as long as the name brands these are the only batteries i buy now,5.0

im not a techie but after days of trying to hook up i gave up i dont know if it was the echo plus or my carrier att uverse causing the issue but it would not connect so back to the store it went even with checking out blogs on the internet for assistancenone of it worked,3.0
my kindle voyage is nearly  months old and worked perfectly i kept receiving emails from amazon about the software update i switched off airplane mode switched on wifi and shortly after the screen locked up i have tried everything with customer support and they now tell me i will have to buy a new one i am very annoyed if i had left the software as it was my kindle voyage would still be working,1.0
this fire tv is a better choice than the fire stick from a connectivity standpoint if you have a lan connection or if you have potential wireless connections it also has the advantage of expandable storage although ive not found a need for it yet as with the newest apple tv the fire tv uses a graphic intensive interface although the fire tv doesnt have the apples volume control selection is somewhat more reliable than the touch pad interface used by apple the only thing keeping this from  stars is the way amazon chooses to organize the selections all in all the fire tv is the best way to take advantage of your amazon prime membership,4.0
having recently received a kindle fire hd as a gift i knew that hooking it up to my computer to charge it daily was not going to be convenient thats when i found this little jewel along with the kindle fire ac charger and they both work like a dream my desk stays uncluttered and the cord allows me to keep the kindle plugged in while i read in bed or listen to music its well worth the price for the convenience it provides,5.0
i have had mine for about  months now  wont last mare than a week in my tv remote pretty annoying,1.0
bought amazon fire tv  this is not the replacement cord for my modelbe aware of what you are purchasing  this is not a fit for the older fire modelsalternate non amazon power cords are available for the older version of fire tv on amazon,2.0
hard to use no way to delete things from screen need better manual most books are impossible if they are reference books,4.0
i had a nook but it died so i wanted a replacement and bought this fire tablet on black friday last year because it was very inexpensive but as the old adage goes you get what you pay for its ok for basic web surfing but its limited slow and has one little speaker on the back so if you lay it on a table you wont be able to hear it very well,2.0

functional but be sure the the usb cable is firmly installed in the base to get a connection,3.0
this thing is garbage do not buy it is the slowest charger ive every had it is not a fast charger it is a disgrace that amazon is offering this product as a fast charger and discontinued the previous all black square blocky fast charger which really was a fast charger this thing is not a fast charger save your money amazon needs to seriously check their supplier the manufacturer of this junkadvertising this thing as a fast charger is totally deceptive,1.0
dont seem to last very long changing brands,2.0
easy to setup but doesnt do everything without additional products better than google home,3.0
good tablet for gamesadds and imails also good size,5.0
bought this for  year old to watch netflix and movies via google playthe entire user experience is amazoncentric the os appears to be androidbased but is repackagedrebuilt as fireos as a result this device does not have an android os userinterfacei was able to install the netflix app but i did not test it you cannot load the google play app which means that all the kids movies ie toy story etc that we intended to play are not available for this reason alone the device is getting returned today,3.0
this product is no different than the fire stick in my opinion it does have more memory and an option where you can add an sd card to it but other than that it is the same as a firestick no reason to pay twice the money for this box,3.0
even when im outside in bright sunlight the words of the book im reading are still crystal clear that alone makes the kindle oasis worth what it cost methe kindle oasis wakes up in just seconds and any book i choose instantly opens ready to be readit is the perfect size and isnt heavy or bulky i really do read for hours at a time sometimes i pace the floor while i read sometimes im on my elliptical machine when i read and sometimes im sitting down no matter what im doing the kindle oasis remains comfortable to hold and it is always easy on my eyeswhen i receive a book that is in pdf most of the time i can enlarge the words if it wont allow me to enlarge the words i can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger i am able to make notes on the book if needed and i can highlight words andor passagesmy merlot leather cover is attractive when i flip it open it is just like opening the cover of a bookhow to make the battery laston the kindle oasis page it says that its dualbattery charging system delivers months of battery life this was a huge thing for me instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day i would be able to read for months without charging the kindleis this how my oasis has performed well not so much there are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your oasis to last for two monthsfirst you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day that one is impossible for me there are days that i am only able to read for thirty minutes but they dont occur very often my kindle goes everywhere with me and i use just about every spare moment to readsecond the wireless needs to be turned off that one is easy to do but not always easy to remember the only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more booksthird this is based on your light setting at  that is way too low for me i keep my light setting anywhere from  to i dont limit my reading to thirty minutes a day and i try to remember to keep my wireless turned off my light setting is kept anywhere from  to  and i put my kindle to sleep the second im done reading so how long does a single charge last me ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far but it would have kept a charge for several more days if i had remembered to turn my wireless off once i succeed in keeping my wireless off i will let you know how long the charge lastsnow i dont plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low i allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover i allow it to drain down to about  before i plug the cover and kindle into my computer to chargethe one thing that surprised me was that everything on the oasis is in black and white for some reason i thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color but since i bought the oasis to read books on color isnt neededspecial offers do appear on my screen but only when my kindle is going to sleep or waking up they arent a distraction and to be honest they are kind of fun to look at you can pay a higher price so they wont appear on your kindle if you would rather not see themi asked myself some questions once i had my kindle and knew just how it worked if i had known before i bought my kindle oasis that the charge wouldnt last for months would i still have bought it yes i would have if i had known that everything would appear in black and white would i still have bought it yes i would have,5.0
they had such positive reviews i suppose its possible that i got a bad batch ive bought the maxcell brand quite a bit which is slightly cheaper than these and i d compare them to rayovak not quite duracell but good these lasted less than half as long crazy i had high hopes as an amazon fan sad,2.0
for the price and quantity i was sure this would be a great buy sadly not all of the batteries worked i first thought the camcorder we purchased was defective but when i swapped out the fresh new batteries for a second round of fresh new batteries from the same package the device magically came to life boo to you amazon for selling batteries that dont actually work,2.0
i purchased a box of these first replacement for my outdoor weather info transmitter didnt work so well within a couple of days the receiver wasnt receiving a signal from the transmitter so i changed out the batteries once again within hrs the receiver once again showed low battery power coming from the transmitter and wouldnt display a temperature reading this week ill replace those again rd time in wks and expect a lowbattery warning just days after unsure if i should demand an exchange or full reimbursement maybe they do well in warm temps but in the cold temps they cannot perform like a duracell or energizer,2.0
this is such a great deal that i opted for the battery package rather than spend the same amount on a pack of rechargeable aas at only  cents per aa cell it is less than the cost of x minutes of my labor associated with charging multiple rounds of rechargeables since i only have a bay charger if you need a sizeable number of batteries at once this deal is hard to beattheyre all meticulously packed in cell wrappers so you wont have  batteries rattling around and tipping over in a jumbled mess the entire line of amazonbasics products is impressivethese batteries are no exception i will definitely repurchase these,5.0

easy to use but more limited than a more powerful tablet such as a galaxy or ipad video conferencing is rather difficult to do in my experience however if you read digital books watch videos or listen to music it works well and the stereo sound with the larger versions is really nice,3.0

i previously owned the fire hd  and was excited about the hd  after getting the hd  and using it i started to notice how they were able to cut costs the screen was not as crisp the processor was slower and the speakers were not as loud as previous versions overall a good buy for the price but if you are expecting the quality that went into previous versions look elsewhere,3.0

alexa is tall slim and attractive but too jealous to use google and that makes her rather dumb and she is just a shill for amazon prime dropping the personification music volume changes annoyingly with different songs and over time the database amazon echo draws from is very limited alexa can tell you what the weather is but not what the most common womans shoe size is what serena williams age is but not how many guns ruger sold last year stand by for more techsavvy companies to take the echo concept to maturity,2.0
its very good tablet for   fast and light good for everyday use and bring along for travel,4.0
good inexpensive tablet for kids its nice being able to set up an account for kids that limits screen time amazons underground apps free apps and discounts on ebooks adds to the valuethe only con is the limited builtin storage only gb free after you account for the system software so an sd card is highly recommended,4.0

my  year old daughter loves this tablet i witnessed her drop it once off the couch to laminate floor nothing i can tell was affected i was a little reluctant to buy this for such a young child but with the way we seem to rely on technology these days plus the cost i just had to buy it my favorite feature is the parental controls that allow me to set times not just times that it can be used but for certain content as well i can set the tablet so when my older kids  and  log in they need to complete educational tasks for an allotted amount of time before free play and the whole thing logs out after a certain time so i dont have to go searching for it in their rooms at night  great tablet glad i got the bumper too great price,5.0

great price for these alkaline batteries being that they are aaa there is not much of a power drain for devices like remote control i found that the aa amazon basic batteries will not last as long as as you named brand alkaline batteries,3.0
this is a good tablet for children and adults too however there is an issue with the port and charger cable we did not even have this tablet  weeks before it would barley charge took it back to best buy and they said they could not fox it and imagine the port is not covered under the manufacturer warranty so now i have a tablet that takes a couple days to charge its really frustrating,2.0

many of our questions to her she miss interpreted or replied as not understanding what we were looking for distance for her to hear us was minimal i returned this one and purchased the google and this one is much better and more knowledgeable with answers both devices recommend using the phone app and also making other purchases for more usage of items that may be available i didnt expect additional charges and so im not to thrilled with either one but i did keep the google device in hopes of better to come in the future,2.0
has good sound but when it comes to answering commands it seems to be a little on the ignorant side,3.0
i bought this tablet on sale when it was  for the price its excellent does everything as expected and a nice bonus is the fact that the screen resolution is very nice and clear again because i purchased it at such a low price its hard to criticize specs such as the processor i would have been a fine pick had it been the regular fifty bucks but in case i didnt mention it already it was ,4.0

its somewhat of a step up from the roku  i was previously using but not as much as i was expecting i think its a couple firmware updates away from being better than it is nowspent the good part of the day trying to figure out why i could only connect to my dualband router at ghz and not ghz  hours on the phone with verizon fios tech support was unsuccessful as other devices connected at ghz without issue was about to pack it up and return it until i called amazon tech support turns out its a knownissue that the firetv has difficulty with ghz networks that are set to auto channel selection and are utilizing channel numbers above the tech support person said i should change the channel to   or  instead of automatic and it workedbluetooth audio and video are out of sync with showtime netflix sling plex and hulu its fine through speakers but video lags slightly behind the audio using bluetooth audio and video are in perfect sync with bluetooth and amazon prime video which makes me think itll be fixed at some point as amazon provided video demonstrates it can work well in that regardgotta say i prefer the platform agnostic ui of roku with amazonworld tucked away in an app the firetv navigation pane represents mostly amazon products with no option to modify it rokus ui is more about the media less about the provider voice search works well if you want only to be presented with amazons viewing options for some reason i thought search was universal but only movies and tv shows available through amazon show up bummer the firetv is ok less than i was expecting and with other good options around the corner im beginning to doubt my choice,2.0
they are too cheap please buy rechargeable batteries instead of wasting the environment,1.0
it is too heavy for its size i purchased it to replace a larger nook and find that it weighs as much screen is attractive but it even with a good signal in public places hanging on to wifi is difficult it is not efficient when downloading buffering buffering and i am still debating returning it for another tablet,2.0
i have no issue with the actual batteries they work fine my problem is with the extremely wasteful packaging the pack comes in an oversized cardboard box with two slots for  batteries each they could just as easily package them in a small thin cardboard box,2.0
this cover is made for the kindle dx and fits it beautifully the problem  and its a big one  is if you accidentlly try to open the cover from the back which is very easy to do you can damage the kindle without even realizing whats happened my husband did this and cracked the kindle frame within the first week of owning the device fortunately only the frame was cracked and the kindle still works we cannot however remove the cover because of the way it hooks into the device the hook closure must be bent because of the accidental attempt to open the back cover after the incident we attempted to clip the back cover to the kindle but found this to be cumbersome and the clip would not stay in place we are just extremely careful now but the damage was done almost immediately i hope this design flaw has been fixed,1.0
great price dont think they last as long as energizer but these might work out cheaper due to quantity and price in purchase compared to energizer,5.0

not so great unless you want to spending alot of money on amazon for everything unable to download any google are android apps,3.0
i understand you get what you pay for but come on amazon you make millions a day and you allow this product to be on your lineup the only thing this tablet is good for is collecting dust in my opinion if any company is going to integrate the androidos at least make it user friendly and  open its basically like purchasing half of a device or a demo device,1.0

i do not like this tablet one bit it has to be registered with amazon for it to function and it failed every time i finally had to resort to calling amazons customer service also not an easy task to get it registered there seems to be glitch in the programming because when it failed again i had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered i would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one companys operations programming or software,1.0
this product is great for children easy to use and very inexpensive allows for enough storage and very durable,4.0

i bought one of these on black friday on impulse since it was  and i had a  certificate to use i have a third generation ipad and am quite accustomed to using it and the app storepros os is android based and not too hard to pick up compared to apple i did find versions of a lot of favorite apps and games to download it can take up to gb microsd card for expanding storage only  gb built in i got a  gb class  card at costco for cons screen resolution is only  x  but i cant say its super noticeable in normal use not all apps available even if an android version exists much more useful if you have amazon prime as it ties directly to an amazoncom account and in fact you have to register the device before you can do much of anything on it battery life is not impressive either with standby time in particular not greatfor the price its a handy spare internet connected device im not one to buy kindle books but the ones i do have are certainly easy to access and read,3.0

very disappointed that my kindle voyage purchased in april failed after just two uses went to charge it tonight to take on a business trip and it wont charge wont reset etc since my best buy receipt says i only have  days to return it tried calling amazon support their only solution after over  minutes on the phone is to process a replacement which may be a new or may be a refurbished device unacceptable to replace a less than month old device with a refurbished one but given the poor experience ive had with the voyage im not even comfortable with a new replacement at this point amazon says they cant do anything about a refund because i purchased from best buy  days seems a little extreme in a situation like this with a defective productstuck with a  paperweight ,1.0

no reason this product is described as w  amp the kindle line is mainly v v whats the difference and around  amp which is  watts w why the mystery guys also this deal is for us v market only i travel i like that the previous simple fire charger was universal ie vv i like that the first kindle charger was also universal what are you people doing or is it that the copywriter in this case just doesnt understandfor those who dont understand the details of electricity any device will tell you what it needs to feed voltage v is one thing to look at and your charger needs to say something within the range of  and  volts to meet your device need as far as amps a if your device says it needs  a its perfectly fine to buy a charger that has a rating higher than that like  amps the device will only drink as much as it needs a device that needs  a plugged into a  a charger just means the charger is taking a nap just avoid situations where your device needs more amps than a charger can provide it wont necessarily explode but it will extend charge times and is generally not recommended,1.0
you get what you pay for here these are cheap batteries and dont last very long id spend the extra and get rechargeables,1.0

for  this is a fine tablet however i bought a gb sd card to expand the storage however i have found that a majority of apps are not able to be saved to the external card  nor can they save data to it for example netflix so be warned that you will run out of space and consider the one with the larger internal storage,3.0

if you are looking for an inexpensive tablet just for basic web surfingshoppingetc i dont know that you can get a better deal however that is about all you can do we found out the hard way that the fire which we bought to replace a misplaced ipad so maybe we were just spoiled is pretty limited in terms of the apps you can download forget about any google based apps and many of the standard apps that are generally available in the android or apple market place i love amazon itself and dont have any major issues with the product i got for the price i paid i just wont be going the cheap route in the future hindsight being  i should have spent the money to just get a new ipad since that is what we were used to,2.0

the reviews on this on amazon seemed awesome little did i know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets we just bought this for christmas and went to charge it for the first time nothing we already loaded and paid for several apps and now were out that money also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before  theres some wear at the edge of it so i went online to see if i could find this issue and there it is  everywhere this is a problem that has been around for years but android  who is the ultimate culprit has failed to fix it at the source when you plug in the charger theres no click so you know its in place it just slides in and out weve had apple products for several years and never had an issue then the first droid product we purchase cant even be charged from the beginning this will be going back to bestbuy  and will buy another ipad mini  costs more but is much much more reliable,1.0

these batteries did their job but did not last very long at all at the time of writing this i used them about two months normally that would be good but i only was using them in a set of led string lights that i kept on at most an hour a day in the past month i barely used them at all because the batteries had started to die and alter the color of the lights i had expected to get a lot longer use out of them considering other brands i only need to change every six months at earliest,2.0
i saw a one day sale on this amazon echo and was planning to buy apples version in december but many review on this echo were above par  speaker sounds great and alexa wakes up easy or stops when yo command so alexa still has a lot to learn causeshe stumble across some geological questions  overall satisfied and i plan on integrating other smart devices with echo great best buy sale i only wish best buy would have sent email stating order was ready  i told a potshot at going there  hrs later but wasat the customer pickup  so i didnt waste the drive ,4.0

we had two appletvs  one in the master bedroom and one in the living room we could not watch both simultaneously because the signal permeated the shared wall and changed the channel of the other tv we got the amazontv to remedy this while it did rectify this problem we find we prefer the ease and simplicity of the appletv over the amazontv the amazon is cumbersome and difficult to navigate,2.0

i bought three of these devices for my niece and nephews and my parents both have one and absolutely love them so i decided to get one myself this was my first personal foray into an android based device being a tried and true ios devotee with a mac and ipad i will say that for this price point and for what it was designed to do the fire tablet is great the os and processor make it a bit clunky and its definitely not designed for high level graphics or photo editing but for basic activities it works great i particularly like the easy to use and transport size i still prefer to read on my kindle but i do read on here as well if you are looking for a basic tablet to use for movies music reading and other media driven activities ideal for amazon prime members this is perfect,4.0

great batteries at a great price whats not to like,5.0
its great for beginners like children but very limiting for me i cant use many apps because it doesnt allow me to use the google play store,3.0
i was disappointed with these batteries i thought they were going to be a higher quality and work as well as the name brand batteries i bought these to use in my sons leapster gs explorers my sons do not play on them nonstop and they shut off on their own after being idle for a few minutes these batteries dont even last  days  hrs of use at the most because we cant afford to go through batteries so quickly i change them once a week its really sad that they dont hold up longer time to go back to brand name as it will save money over these and use some rechargables do not buy if you plan on using these for something more than a remote or clock,2.0

i dont know if i just got a bad batch or not but some of these batteries are partially discharged i opened a pack of  put them in a device and it gave me a low battery indication i swapped them out with  more from the same box and they worked,2.0
these are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft yet bulky a good thing in this instance case the only thing i wish was that it could access the google play store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our google play movies account,3.0
for the price you cannot beat the deal on a tablet crystal clear picture and very fast ok so the wide variety of apps available on an apple or android are not here but most major apps are and if the app is not available just go to their website a simple fix,5.0
i wanted a small tablet to read news and watch videos i have amazon prime so i figured why not it is really cheap well i believe you get what you pay for this fire tablet froze on me when i only had one thing open i am very disappointed it also is very slow when you rotate the screen ugh i will be returning it,2.0
a lot of the times alexa will come back and say i dont understand the question get very annoying,3.0
batteries didnt last long at all,1.0
kindle is good as long as it is plugged into a wall outlet the battery lasts a mere  minutes as a portable unit not happy with this takes an hour to charge the battery to  yet drains in  minutes theres something mathematically wrong with this equation,2.0
i purchased  of these as christmas gifts for nieces  nephew,4.0

this product really helped my father in law hear and have conversations with his daughter whos voice is a higher pitch,4.0
not the longest lasting batteries but theyre batteries weve gone through the package really quickly,3.0
while it seemed to work fine the tap does not have the open mic feature while that can be best for some i bought it as a gift and they would prefer one that listens the tap makes you press the mic button every time you wish to communicate with alexa which seems to defeat the purpose,2.0
overall not a bad tablet the price is good and the features are pretty nice it was bought as a gift and i can say that she loved it,4.0
if you like to read books i totally recommend this product i love reading books and the kindle paperwhite really helps i used to read books on the ipad all the time but it would strain my eyes after reading all the reviews i decided it was finally time to get a ereader since i had my ipad already i just needed one to strictly read books so i got the paperwhite it is so nice to read from especially in the sun its almost like reading from the actual book its the perfect size to read in one hand and stores so many books even some for my child its also great for traveling i have all my books on hand no matter where i go  there are only two cons to the paperwhite one is that the touch screen is not that receptive as compared to an ipad at times it doesnt register my swipes or taps the other con is that its only black and white it really isnt a problem when im reading just for the childrens books,4.0
i feel like i have been completely lied to about this device despite reviews claiming a hands free mode that does not exist in the settings i just downloaded the app for the first time today and there is no hands free option to enable in settings and pandora said its not available in the us on this amazon tap thanks for ruining a birthday amazon,1.0
as an avid book reader i have always loved having an actual book i was very reluctant to get a kindle at first however it has been such a surprise its very light weight and thus easier to hold then a traditional book you can easily download new books at the click of a button there are daily and monthly deals you can take advantage of for a fraction of the cost of a regular book the viewing experience is superb because you can change fonts and size and increase or decrease background lighting making it very easy to read in any light if i dont know a word i can automatically look up the definition or add highlights or notes plus i can carry an entire library with me where ever i go i actually read way more now than i ever did before i am extremely impressed with this device and its more than exceeded my expectations i highly recommend it to anyone,5.0
this is great its a lot of fun and much better than i expected,5.0
we really are enjoying asking alexa questions and she is connected to our sonos system playing music around the house she doesnäôt always understand me not sure if it is her or me,4.0
it doesnt work with my amazon wireless mouse,2.0
gave the family the echo for christmas and we are still learning how it can be used so far it is a hands free siri not a bad thing that can be used by the whole family it is an easy and fun way for us to learn about the iot,4.0
bought this for my grandson along with a case for his birthday he loves it and all the apps available for a kid his age,4.0
bought it on sale  off regular price no brainer smoother performance than i expected,4.0
funsometimes difficult in phrasing my question fr alexa i love it but still having difficulty finding the ap to enable different things n love the music and sound is good,4.0
really  aa batteries for just over ten bucks what a great deal,5.0
worst batteries i have ever purchased i use in the mouse to my laptop doesnt hold a charge for more than three days with limited usage maybe  hoursday not worth the price,1.0
i really liked the idea of having a device i could talk to out of nowhere that would answer although our cells phones can do similarly but you have to turn them on and press buttons etc it is also gratifying to be able to tell a device to play music and it doesi was quite disappointed in the ability of alexa to answer any serious questions jeff needs to pay to send his programmers back to search school so many times alexa says a phrase similar to i dont understand the questionso basically i paid for a radio i paid extra for the larger one but the output is still no different than a clock radiocome on amazon,2.0
overall we enjoy our new echo tower the speaker is not the same quality as our sonos or bose speakers but the convenience of being able to ask alexa to play a song or find a style of music or tell you the weather or traffic as you are running out the door make up for the quality the kids love asking her to rap or tell a joke i look forward to syncing alexa to more of our iot items to make controls hands free,4.0
great device works great and so far no issues ,4.0
good value at a very affordable price cant beat it,5.0
the speaker on this unit really impressed me it is as good as my little bose bluetooth speaker super convenient to stream music from amazon prime this product is a nice add on to those who are amazon prime members i am looking forward to integrating it with more things,4.0
been using amazon aa and aaa batteries over the past  months in a variety of electronic items and have found that they do not last as long as higher quality higher price batteries i guess you get what you pay for,2.0
this is an inexpensive alternative to a tablet and larger than a phone the memory is small at  gb but can be expanded with a micro sd card plus you are not slowed down by constant windows  downloads,4.0
if you are a prime member and use kindle for reading this a great tablet i wish there were more apps made to work in the fire tablet like nfl mobile and nfl fantasy,4.0
great to have during the holidays,4.0
its good for lil kids n small stuff  doesnt look very fast,3.0
it will not charge in usb on computer have to take it in,2.0
this is a great value,5.0
these are okay they arent as longlasting as name brands so in the end im probably not saving money using these that said i like how they are packaged so they take up little space and we only have to open a  pack each time while still having plenty on hand this beats the big packages of the name brands where the left over batteries end up falling out of the package and scatter in the drawer,3.0
this is a great entrylevel tablet for someones first tablet,4.0
this is the rd kindle we have purchased and they keep getting a little nicer with each version the light on this one is a really nice feature the battery life is better the page turning options are better it is lighter there are just a lot of nice little improvements if you like to read in an electronic format i cannot imagine disliking the kindle,5.0
good size screen and clarity for the money seems fairly robust the biggest problem is putting apps on it at least free games they do not have a great selection and when i put them on some of them require you turn on tracking so they can collect information or they wont let you play it,3.0
this is my third alexa and im very satisfied with its functionality it works well with smart devices such as lights locks thermostats and so on i highly recommend it if youre in the market for a similar device dont think twice,5.0
dont buy dont last,1.0
these batteries provide power at a cheaper cost than most use these mainly for my xbox controller because it eats batteries,5.0
this is not what i received,1.0
she is like my personal assistant but i wish she is as smart as siri but since there is no one else like her she will do for now,3.0
these are good if youre broke and just need to get by they work but like other reviewers are saying they dont last as long as other brands or rechargeable batteries if you have the money invest in batteries that last longer and tax the environment less,3.0
love the kindle does not need any lightfits in my purselightweight,5.0
alexa is great when asking about the weather or when wanting to play some music quickly however majority of the questions i ask it cannot find i think that the questions are pretty simple too she will answer questions with direct answers like whats  but if you go much further she wont respond,3.0
nd time purchasing these battteries they last a long time in everything i have put them into baby toysremotesgame controllers etc just as good as the name brand or better zer complaints,5.0
these batteries did not work in all items needing aaa batteries i wont be ordering them again,2.0
they dont last long,3.0
i personally like that it is relatively small and light in weightso easy to handle for my toddlerwith the increased number of games and apps downloaded on the tablett it slows down in speed that for sure i dislike but over al it is good to have when on the go on car rides or long periods of waiting,4.0
i love that my son loves to read and all so the kindle is perfect for him it updates and is very easy to use i dont like that its as fragile as it is my  year old has plenty of electronics but the screen has already cracked on this one im not too happy about that,3.0
this equipment is an joy to havei would recommend product to friends,4.0
update june batteries do not last long at all i am using mostly for wireless mouse  battery last approx  weeks in my humble opinion that is terrible i retract my previous reviewprevious reviewfantastic price wonderful reliable product i am a tried and true believer and purchaser,2.0
kindle fire is good because of the other things you can do besides just reading books but it is slow and hard to read in sun,3.0
these are ok but they dont hold up or last very long we bought these during christmas hoping they would be great esp since alkaline but they barely hold up to the wear and tear of everyday use in a tv remote let alone a kids toy,2.0
i like how it plays music it is perfect to connect to smart home products such as nest belkin  and many others it is easy to use,4.0
very good for the price our kid loves to play with it,5.0
if i could give it a lower rating i wouldthis is nothing more than a speaker and a big oneit is not wireless so you cannot even take it outside wo a power source you cannot ask questions and have alexa search answers very expensive would like to try google but since i cannot return this  i cant justify the price everyone said give it time to like alexa i gave it too much time and did not realize you had to return within a time frame my bad,1.0
as good as any other battery,3.0
my kids enjoy this tablet as do i the only downfall so far is the brightness does not dim very much even on the lowest setting so my kids are not allowed to use it in bealso uses a ton of memory even though no additional applications have been downloaded since purchased and no photos taken,4.0
the screen really does add tremendous value the bugs are almost all worked out and the quality of hearing my commands is night and day from a month ago,4.0
got this for my  year old grandson he really likes it a lot this is good for kids to learn responsibility using tablets,3.0
i have had a kindle for a long time i chose to upgrade to the paperwhite i am very happy with my decision,5.0
first day after purchasing the tablet the screen turned green since then it has given us problems with the screen turning green i will be returning the item,1.0
st kindle screen failed  had to reboot often customer service couldnt fix replaced nd one screen reboots often customer service offered replace just want one that works cant get upgrade replacement,2.0
it all depends on what your using a  dollar tablet to do is it for extreme gaming then i highly do not recommend this device it is better for light use on the safe side use for h a day h a day battery is the average but runs down faster and over heats when playing a d game but if u are on tight budget it is useful another major problem is that almost all apps that you would get on iphone and android are not availabe on the amazon fire appstore and there is no way to download them for example clash of clans racing rivals which have decided to withdraw from the amazon contract and delte there game off amazons app stores and other bigger titles omg even snapchat is not on there,2.0
i had trouble deciding between the regular kindle and the paperwhite because i read at night it was a great decision because when i turn the light all the way down i cant read at night its lightweight and sturdy my only complaint is the speed of switching between books and the strange flicker with the page turn its not a show stopper because it is so much better than trying to read on my ipad mini,4.0
performs as expected an excellent value especially for lose looking for a reasonably priced gift for techiesor for kids,4.0
this was a gift from my wife i wanted a lighter kindle and this is it i have been happy with this new version,4.0
 i bought four of these tablets two of them i need to return because as soon as my nephews turn them on there were problems with screen being almost completely white and black in the corners you cant see anything ive checked the settings its not the city its the tablet smh i am disappointed,1.0
this is exactly like any other usb power charger making it unnecessary a basic charger used for an ipod works to charge the kindle fire within  hours,1.0
these batteries do not last nearly as long as the bunny or copper brands i will use them up and never waste my time or money on these again i have been using them in an led flashlight,1.0
bought this for my daughter and she cant even use it because it is not kid friendly it is so incredibly slow it freezes often and does not seem to work without wifi like it is supposed to also was supposed to come with a year free of amazon free time and we have been charged for it every month  it requires you to put a card number in before initial use  keep calling amazon and the foreign people cant seem to figure out the problem dont buy,1.0
i got this for my son for his th birthday and he loves it the kids section is the best,5.0
i purchased this for my mom in hopes that she would learn to email we are still working on it but the tablet is good for basic needs and the price was great,4.0

alexa is great  is a great house hold tool around the house  timers alarm  sleep machine everything u need,4.0
is a god but i have to pay  dollar a year is to bad,3.0
great deal dont waste any more money buying batteries at the store you cant beat the price and they work and lask as well as brand name batterys it it amazing how much cheaper these are and you get twice as many i got these in aa aaa c and d the main reason i even bought them was when i was looking for flashlight batteries size d for my trusty maglight yes they are heavy but i love them for it they are perfect for a car and the weight keeps it steady if you have to put it down and size c for a different flashlight of course i needed an odd number and couldnt believe how expensive they were in the store i checked amazon had no clue amazon had their own batteries and noticed that in all of the sizes the price was less then the smallest pack of that size in the store and had twice as many batteries did i need this many aaa batteries at the time nope but let me tell you im so glad i got extra less than a week after buying them i had already nearly used every one i went around the house and replaced every remote and device i could find and they work great with aa and aaa size id recommend buying a bigger pack yes it does seem like a lot of batteries at first but trust me youll be glad you got extra its one of those items every house needs and easily gets overlooked,5.0
very helpful product that is fun to use and easy to use,4.0
i have two macs each with their own wireless mac keyboards i used these batteries in both keyboards and each worked great for several days my desk keyboard failed to connect last week so i attempted to replace the batteries but they had expanded inside the keyboard and will not come out i assumed it was a chance happening but now my wireless keyboard at my downstairs computer just failed the batteries have expanded inside that keyboard as well and will not come out amazon refunded us for the batteries but now we need to replace the two keyboards the batteries ruined,1.0

i looked at the math about the capacity and strength and longevity of different batteries and a lot of them are similar including these and these make the most sense price wisei have tried hundreds of rechargeable batteries and they get recharged a couple of times and then disappear at a certain point they are just a waste of money,4.0
do not buy themi got them because it said they were anti leakage well guess whatthey leaked completely destroyed my keyboard and i cant even open it up to get the batteries out a waste of money and will also cost me a whooping  for a new keyboard and i cant use my desktop until i get a new keyboard,1.0

i purchased  others for my   yrolds and my yrold niece enjoyed playing theirs so much i then bought this one for her the included yr subscription to freetime is awsome for the kids parental controls are great and included apps are helpfulthe lower rating is because the charging port was extremely loose as the cord falls out all the time very frustrating,3.0

this amazon fire tablet is a great tablet and very affordable,5.0
this is an excellent choice for an ereader i purchased it specifically for a vacation in the sun it did a great job was easy to use and overall allowed me to easily read out in the bright sun the backlit display at night was very nice and makes reading a breeze anytime without problem i have an older nook book that is color i chose the amazon version so that i could subscribe to the unlimited monthly reading program in comparison between the  brands i do like the nook better for easy of moving between pages  i havent figured that out quite yet on the kindle but im sure its quite easy theres also no person that i can quickly drop into the store to ask a question on how to do something if you are a person who likes being shown how to use a device i know my mom who is  might have a little problem with some getting the screen at the top to pull down but  of the people most likely wont best thing i like and am glad i invested was the backlight,4.0

overall the tablet is okay i just paid  so cant complain anything about specs but the fact that you cant use google services sucks no google no youtube gmail,2.0
never again will i purchase this the outer cardboard box is frustrationfree but the batteries are tightly shrinkwrapped in groups of four you need to cut into the wrap to begin to separate the batteries pull them apart then cut a little slice into the wrap around each battery then figure out how to pull each battery out of its little plastic straitjacketeven if these batteries function well the hassle of unwrapping them  shrinkwrapped sets of four batteries isnt worth any cost savings,2.0

not what i was looking for but they are ok,3.0
ill give them two stars for the price but you really do get what you pay for these batteries seemed to die a lot faster than the kirkland ones i got from costco or maybe its just some of them that fail too soon i put several new amazon aa batteries in a few different devices that get a good amount of use when a couple of those devices stopped working i tested the batteries in both cases only one battery was actually dead the other was fine that seems weird weird enough that ill go back to costco for my next battery purchase,1.0

so ive been wanting a fire since they originally came out read some questionable reviews about kindle basic stuff nothing seemed to really discourage me you really dont know what your experience will be unless you try so i got it and began the prime free trial  i was shocked to wake up this morning to find out i had been charged  for a full year of prime one day before my trial was supposed to end no email no contact no are you interested they just charged my card without warning imaginably upset with amazon the tablet it self is so so and is slightly basic the front facing camera is slightly better then the outwards one the alexa feature is kinda nice and fun to talk to it also syncs to other echo devices as well if buying for a teenager or any young adult do set parental controls and or passwords to keep from unauthorized perchues i think the tablet is ok but no great but because of my recent experience i rated it it  stars your ultimately going to make up your own mind and decided if your going to purchase this device and decide if its right for you good luck in your decision,2.0

ive had every kindle ereader available though it doesnt have all the features available on the voyage the paperwhite is the best the issue ive had are the emergence of tiny light leaks emerging from the source through the matte textured page background theyre little pinholesized bright light scattered across the page it usually begins with just one or two and becomes several over time its distracting to reading in a conventional book it would be like having a small speck of dirt on the page if these little things dont bother you then its not an issue the paperwhite models dont seem to have this problem as often as the voyage does i went through  voyage models before surrendering and returning to the paperwhite the paperwhite has fewer total lights so its not as evenly lit as the voyage however its nothing significant,3.0

you have to purchase the power outlets light switches and other things for alexa to communicate with once you do and setup them up it works pretty well you have to be careful if you put it near the tv where they might do a commercial or a story about it on the news alexa has pretty good hearing and perks up when she hears her name over all easy to set up with the app and works pretty well takes some time getting used to asking alexa to turn on or off the lights and not just reaching for the light switch,4.0

the longevity of these batteries is nothing special they do not compare to duracell or energizer alkalines after reading the reviews i was greatly disappointed i used them among others for a wall clock and remote controller their longevity is no better than alkaline batteries marketed and sold by walgreens for example take this into consideration before you buy them,2.0

the fire tv is a good device with a powerful processor and the best playstation vue interface however it can be frustrating to access the channels youve added as you have to either search for the channel or thumb through them all  one by one the roku allows you to arrange your channels in whatever order you choose the roku has the most channel options  including vudu a channel not available on the fire tv still if you intend to use the playstation vue service youll be much happier with the fire tv,3.0

unfortunately some of the batteries seem to be duds i have replaced dead batteries with these only to still have a dead remote great price but i now know why,2.0
i have bought  of the amazon fire tv boxes i love how many online services you can access via the fire i would rate this a perfect  if it was not for the fact that the fire remote is so poorly made  of the  remotes died before the batteries did sure you can use your phone to control the fire tv box but that is slow and should not have to be done and dont try to get help from amazon their idea of help is to have you buy a new fire tv box,3.0

i like the kindle fire over all but the kindles definitely have issues with the charging ports we have the older s and we have issues with getting the cords to charge them as a parent you are better off not having children plug them in we still continue to purchase new one because of the reasonable pricing and due to all the amazon app purchases we have made through the years hopefully one day they will design a better charging port,3.0

i purchased this box in hopes of using it for the new playstation vue service which it did run pretty well it does everything they say it does but one of the main issues i had with the original and still have with this is the interface the layout for the main screen and the ads they throw in your face are just ridiculous after using roku for years the nvidia shield tv and the new apple tv i would recommend any of those over this device any day they offer a much cleaner interface and more functionality for the most part except playstation vue,3.0

when companies play nice with each other the customers win this product is fairly novel if you arent completely bought in to the amazon ecosystem i would use it way more if they played nice with apple services i know its a competitor but if both companies goals are to build an awesome product for a customer they should play nice,3.0

i purchased this kindle for my wife because her kindle fire gives off too much glare to use in sunny conditions besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the fire since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus the main drawback is that the graphics arent as clear with this reader all in all it was money well spent,4.0
