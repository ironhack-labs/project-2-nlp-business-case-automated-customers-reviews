its a decent tablet but keep the following in mind if you get this for your kids to share your amazon prime account for video and game apps you have to lock it to prevent accidental purchases problem is that this prevents free app and video purchases and you have to okay every thing they do  if you allow them access to apps and video then that can purchase anything without limitson top of this they lock out the google app store and refuse to even allow access to google drive while you can hack it to add these basic features you will need a modicum of technical knowledge to do soso its useful but a pain too your needs may vary,3.0,neutral

this tablet could be so much better if the apps actually worked decently the built in amazon pieces for prime members is great and work flawlessly but its not enough to overcome the terrible app behavior and countless freezes they need to take a lesson or two from apple,2.0,negative
traded in the echo for google home after trying both did the training questions but still found it could only answer  of  questions there were many specific apps but trying to remember the cues words is more difficult google home answers without cue words the first time and can extend a conversation based on the first question can ask for driving times to destinations without an app same for getting a cocktail recipe very dry responses where gh has personality try them both before deciding what is best for your needs,3.0,neutral

let me set the stage for this review i joined a book club this year and have started reading a lot or at least what i would consider to be a lot which is about  decentlylong books a monthup until buying the paperwhite i was doing most of my reading on my iphone using the kindle app long story short i ended up returning the paperwhite after about  weeks why because i realized just how sporadic my reading was i read when im out and about waiting at a doctors office or inline at a restaurant etc it became overwhelmingly apparent to me that the best ereader is the one you have with you at all times for me thats my iphonethe actual reading experience is definitely better on the paperwhite however if youre an onthego reader like me then it just means you have to carry around another device dedicated ereaders are for people who either truly read a ton or have a set routine for reading if thats not you then stick with your phone,3.0,neutral

we switched from an older model tablet to this simplified kindle fire for the price it is a decent reader which is primarily what we were seeking but it has its limitationsthe primary user in the house used it to read before bed he feels the lowest brightness setting is still too bright so he defaults his booksdocuments to black screen however words in italics default to the screen background which means they are black dohhe also doesnt like the persistence of the washington post popping up on his home screen he finds it a bit annoying however he doesnt mind the ads and suggested content from amazon at all it is just the washington post that he doesnt likebeyond those minor things it is an inexpensive and feature rich ereader being amazon prime customers we share content between our accounts with ease now that we both are on kindle platform,3.0,neutral
i bought myself a kindle earlier this summer and love it so much that i decided to get one for my ten year old i thought she was spending too much time engaging in mindless activities on her phone and computer and thought this might be a good alternative she has responded surprisingly well one feature that i really like is the dictionary if she comes across a word she doesnt know or cant read she can tap on it and the dictionary will pop up defining the word this enables her to use her inference skills to decode the word or understand the meaning better this has been a nice addition to her bedtime routine,5.0,positive

amazon seems to have changed the manufacturer of this battery i liked it very much the last year but the new one has a different look has noticeably lower capacity and leaks batteries usually leak after they die but these leaked while they were still good and apparently died because of the leak all of my devices have battery monitored one day they were good with  power left and they died suddenly the next day the leaks were mostly minor but clearly noticeable from body discolorationone thing that has not changed from before is the packaging and it is still bad they are shrinkwrapped  in a package and they are hard to open as there is no cutout or pulltab to break the wrap it is difficult to break open by hand twisting the package causes undue stress to the batteries and that may be cause of the leak i have had to use scissors or knife to cut open the package,2.0,negative

this is not as cheap feeling as i thought it was going to be its definitely not in the ipad class but its not bad for what it is i ordered online and did not have one in my hands until mine arrived pros the screen is decent sound is loud enough for me no lag scrolling and real racing  plays smoothly cons the major down side is battery charging time battery life and built in storage space when it arrived it was showing  remaining after less than  hours use it had to be charged i just read where it can take  hours or longer to charge my ipad air  can fully charge in a few hours from  built in storage is not enough yes you can get micro sd cards however some apps will only install on the built in storage also you can not delete amazon apps without voiding the warranty and unless im missing something you cant move them eitherso if you are looking for something to use casually for web surfing email watching movies reading books and the occasional game this should be just finekeeping in mind the battery life and lack of built in storage but you wont be doing any serious work on this like you can on the ipads but to be fair this is  the price of my ipad air  and  the cost of an ipad mini  but i dont believe its meant to be a direct ipad competitor because if it were it would fail miserably,3.0,neutral
bought this as a cheaper alternative for using with kids battery lasts longer than most tablets the reason why i gave this such a mediocre rating is because you cant put a wallpaper for the lock screen you always have an ad for something amazon related which can be annoying but if its just something small for the kiddos to use good choice i wouldnt recommend for adults,3.0,neutral

i like amazonbasics products so i was excited to see these batteries to find out if they were a good value i looked up data online bottom line for flashlights toys and steady drain devices youll be better off buying rayovac alkalines here on amazon for cameras and photo flashes duracell coppertops will be betterheres why rayovacs cost a little bit more per battery but they hold more energy than these amazonbasics batteries as a result the final price per amount of power is about the same you just wont have to change batteries as oftenthose rayovacs work best in steady drain devices but not so well in cameras or flashes for those high drain devices duracell coppertops hold up better and end up being cheaperbattery ninja tested these amazonbasics aas in toothbrushes i did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power mwh but that they do not carry as much energy as others the test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others at least in the toothbrushes there were no test results vs digital cameras photo flashes or toys so im extrapolating that these will perform like rayovacs not like duracell coppertopsso the only data to compare here is the toothbrush test for energy delivered these amazonbasics batteries cost about the same as rayovac batteries but will die sooner to say that another way these batteries cost less but also deliver less powerboth rayovac and amazon basics are better than energizer batteries which appear to consistently give less power and still cost more i guess the money goes to the energizer bunnyduracell coppertops will last longer in flashlights toys and toothbrushes but cost a little bit more per unit of power mwh on the other hand they hold up better in cameras and similar electronics theyre probably the best all around battery so if you dont like changing batteries and a willing to spend a tiny bit more coppertops are a good way to gofinally the best value battery is interesting it is the costco kirkland signature battery ninjas results show that and so do the tests from consumer reports you can buy those costco batteries here on amazon but the price is higher than youd get at the club of course im not a costco member so it doesnt matter to me but buying them here on amazon is not a good value,3.0,neutral

i have an older fire hd  and had started reading a lot more periodicals on it okay i admit it comic books so when the news about the fire hd  th generation went out i put in a preorder and eagerly anticipated its arrival so i could have just a slightly larger screen and better performancethe fire hd  delivered on those two fronts its noticeably snappier than my hd  and the screen is larger no arguing those pointsmy fire hd  arrived charged to  so i hooked it up to the included charger and set it to download some of the aforementioned periodicals i checked on it two hours later and noticed that it had managed a measly  increase in battery charge in that time starting at  i would have expected it to at least be in the mid to high s after two hoursafter experimenting a bit i found that the only way i could get a sort of decent charging speed was to turn the fire hd off altogether and let it charge with absolutely nothing else running i am now able to charge at a rate of about  every  to  minutes an improvement over  per half hour but it means having to fully turn off the fire hd before i plug it in and then restart it when i want to use it again the fire hd  will maintain an even charge level while it is plugged in and in use but dont expect it to replenish the battery in that stateaside from that the fire hd  seems a decent tablet for a  price point just dont expect it to fully charge overnight if you deplete it the day before,3.0,neutral

weve tried several of these little streamer boxes  fire tv roku apple tv not the newest one i think the roku is my favorite this one is competent if you have amazon prime youll miss it on the apple tv but the voice command mode  the one distinguishing feature of the fire  is not useful it only searches amazon content and while amazon has a lot of stuff we watch more on netflix hbo showtime hulu etc so not so useful i would get the roku the remote with headphones is a great feature,3.0,neutral

lets be realistic on two fronts about the echo  its fun to play with a novel idea  there are some serious flaws and if you doubt me you can try these yourself ask alexa these three questions what is the customer service number for ups youll be told the phone number of your nearest ups store no matter how you phrase the question alexa what is the current humidity outside youll get the days weather report no matter how you pose the question seriously it cannot even provide the humidity alexa who makes the  jet youll hear hmmm im not sure what you meant by that question so throw in a clue with alexa who makes the boeing  jet and youll hear the same answer and this product is alleged to go out to the web to pull down information from wikipedia et al the reproduction of music is egregious at best read anywhere on the internet and youll see this mentioned time and time again its very very bad imagine a s transistor radio not quite tuned well the voice quality sounds like something from a commodore back in the s another very common complaint youll read about in reviewsthis is going back tonight not worth the  and i feel its slated to go the route of the pet rock for those who remember it,1.0,negative

i as well as other kindle lovers have noticed that although we have taken great care with the cover it has warped and has bubbles and is not durable within  months and i only started using the kindle with the cover in the past  weeks noticed the cover has become warped and bubbled under the leather no idea what would cause this i have taken great care not to put it near any source that would have done this damage not sunlight heat moisture or anything i will be requesting a replacement but kindle manufacturers of the cover need to do their homework and come up with a better product especially for the price we paid,1.0,negative

counting back this is my th kindle since they came out ive never had to replace one that died but sometimes i want the newer features this one is to replace the older books only unit that is starting to be uncooperative that i take to work for reading during lunch id have probably just gotten another reading only unit like a paperwhite but these were less expensivepluses can carry movies music etc like my kindle hd fire can easily let me shop on amazon can access free underground apps i really dont need it for games though and it is simple to useminus uses power quickly like the kindle fire hd i have to charge it daily to every other day i set a password very highly recommended to prevent unauthorized uses or purchases it has given me minor problems with books by marking that i was on a different page than where i stopped and it links to the other kindles and they go to that page as well for some reason accessories like cases are more expensive if you want to store a good deal more you require an sd chip  for  gb,4.0,positive
i was completely under the impression that this tablet was child friendly but there are no built in restrictions so my son was able to purchase numerous apps and movies my son usually uses my wifes ipad so i thought this tablet would be a good replacement but the interface is geared towards adults not a young child if you buy this tablet immediately change the settings to require a pin to make purchasesi think the age recommendation should be  not ,3.0,neutral
