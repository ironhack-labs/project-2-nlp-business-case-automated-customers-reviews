a day or two after these batteries arrived i installed several of them in toys and our small keyboard which also has ac power the next morning my son called me into the living room mom theres chocolate sauce all over the piano and the table it wasnt chocolate sauce it was battery acid as he said good thing i didnt taste itfor what its worth the keyboard was plugged in and it had not been turned on or played since the batteries were installed the five new batteries were in place for about  hours before the leak was discoveredthe green seal fell off of two of the five batteries as i removed them from the compartment the acid left a  stain on my tablethe other batteries that i installed that day still seem to be okay although ive developed a paranoia about checking them i have used amazon batteries in the past with no problems which is why im giving  stars instead of  the attached photo shows the rings that fell off i wish id taken a photo of the puddle they left on the keyboard and table but i was too focused on cleanup to stop and take a pictureyoull also note that these batteries are darker in color than the product image that is currently shown they came this way and ill use that difference to keep an eye on their performancedurability,2.0,negative

i bought this to replace a year old kindle fire  hdx that i had just dropped on the floor i sort of panicked so after doing a couple of hours of research i picked this tablet just to be on the safe side i got  additional gb of memory i installed a couple of games none of them memory hogs and a cookbook app in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries i can honestly say this is the slowest tablet ive ever had just rotating the screen takes  seconds and thats if theres only one app open opening a book or magazine can take half a minute and god help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while youre cooking amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers since there are no other fire tablets available for whatever reason maybe theyre being discontinued ill be replacing it with either an ipad or a galaxy tablet,1.0,negative

i came here to look at the one and two star reviews and see that people are saying the same thing ive been thinking since trying to use my first shipment of these batteries which are supposed to be better than the previous version that they replaced ive used  of these batteries so far and each one has barely lasted  weeks in my mouse the previous version usually lasted a couple months at least it seems like in this day and age its rare that when things are supposedly improved upon that theyre actually better i can only guess that amazon found a cheaper supplier for their branded batteries i guess its time to cancel my subscribe and save subscription since im not the only one who finds these batteries to be subpar to their predecessors if the rest of the batteries in this pack perform better ill update my review to reflect thatedited to add on  now that the th battery from this pack lasted just over  weeks in my mouse i will be contacting amazon customer service as i mentioned previously the older version of these batteries worked so well that i have to wonder why they changed them i see the larger size amazon batteries still carry the older name,1.0,negative

this cover is a replacement for the initial cover that broke my kindle framewhere the top hinge goes into the kindle the metal on the original hinge system was too light weight to withstand having the cover fold all the way back on the kindle and after just over a year resulted in the hinge becoming bent up towards the frame and it cracked the frame on my kindlei understand this new kindle cover is supposed to have corrected that problembut the hinge system looks identical to the one that was on my old cover i hope that over time again about a year plus it wont crack the frame in the same place again on my new kindlei am so thankful that amazon replace both my kindle and the book cover as a result of this problemi would recomend that after about  months use it would be wise to remove the cover from your kindle and see if the top hinge is beginning to bend upwards towards the frame and if so contact amazon before the frame of your kindle breaks where the top hinge inserts into your kindle,3.0,neutral
no reason this product is described as w  amp the kindle line is mainly v v whats the difference and around  amp which is  watts w why the mystery guys also this deal is for us v market only i travel i like that the previous simple fire charger was universal ie vv i like that the first kindle charger was also universal what are you people doing or is it that the copywriter in this case just doesnt understandfor those who dont understand the details of electricity any device will tell you what it needs to feed voltage v is one thing to look at and your charger needs to say something within the range of  and  volts to meet your device need as far as amps a if your device says it needs  a its perfectly fine to buy a charger that has a rating higher than that like  amps the device will only drink as much as it needs a device that needs  a plugged into a  a charger just means the charger is taking a nap just avoid situations where your device needs more amps than a charger can provide it wont necessarily explode but it will extend charge times and is generally not recommended,1.0,negative

just got this as a christmas gift and it doesnt stand nothing to secure it to make it stand you can get it to stand maybe to watch a video but dont touch it it will fall down easily certainly dont stand it and actually use your fire hd with this cover you cant falls right over i feel really badly for the special person that bought me this waste of money i had already bought my own cover for a lot cheaper that has more shock protection and that one wont stand on end but at sits securely at a tilt which makes it more useful for me the cheaper one i bought on amazon also has a magnetic closer to the cover stays closed this one does not not sure how to tell the person who bought me this that i dont like this one at all ill feel bad telling them and theyll feel bad hearing it bad all around,1.0,negative
when i got my kindle fire i got a protective cover for it and figured id be ok because i dont travel much at all am bedriddendisabled from car accidents after a while i couldnt get the miniusb cord to stay in the plug on the kindle after describing the problem to amazon they sent me a new cord i got the newer one with an ac plug and had to pay for it unfortunately this did not solve the problem and i had to mail them my kindle and they shipped me a new one configured mostly the way i had everything before i sent it which was very convenient using my new cable purchased through the amazon kindle store i had no problems at firstwith only very light use primarily for reading books for short intervals the problem i had before with the mini usb plug on the kindle not fitting tightly into its socket after changing up ac to usb as well as trying both usbs on my computer i was unable to get the kindle to start because it had less than  charge on the battery but i had no way to charge it the only way to resolve the issue would be to go through the procedure described above i read a number of the positive reviews which are usually posted first and nothing was mentioned about this problemthere were so many reviews i didnt have the time to go through them all im in the middle of a book and use the kindle to play scrabble with a friend and were in the middle of a gameso i havent decided what to do yet its after  am sunday morning so i cant call the kindle store for advicei had been considering upgrading to one of the new kindle products but after having this recurring problem i am leery of spending that kind of money only to possibly have the same issueread more,2.0,negative

pros amazon prime works on it you can still sideload apps like kodicons not a good upgrade over the original fire tv is worse in some aspects remote buttons are hard to press compared to original fire tv remote loses connection frequently and takes several button presses or removing of the remote batteries to fix interface isnt as snappy as the original fire tv same interface as the original fire tv theres still no good way to sort your apps or locate the prime content that you want voice search seems about the same as the original fire tv alexa adds nothing significant you still cant use it to search in rd party apps like youtube as for video decoding in kodi performance isnt much better than the original fire tv you will be able to play hevc content at p with no problem but p  hip softwaredecoded does not play well theres simply not enough power k decoding is hitand miss it needs to be specifically coded for this fire tv low bitrate low fps to work properly overall system performance is bad when sitting idle the cpus spike up to  usage and memory is at  usage the os is not welloptimizedim not confident that amazon can fix these issues in a timely manner and their competitors are releasing their media players soon so ill likely return this while i still can,2.0,negative

they are batteries and they do work but not for long i pretty much base battery quality by how long they last in my wireless mouse generally i have to replace my home mouse every  months i purchased these amazon basics aa performance alkaline batteries  months ago in that time ive replaced my home mouse battery  times the rd being yet again today my daughter has also gone through  batteries in her mouse as well though she spends most of her time on her laptop with the touchpadthe shipping was fast and you get several batteries for a low cost but i think a more economical way to go is to spend a little extra on name brand dependable batteries that last  times as long,2.0,negative
