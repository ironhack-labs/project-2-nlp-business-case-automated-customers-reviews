the reviews on this on amazon seemed awesome little did i know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets we just bought this for christmas and went to charge it for the first time nothing we already loaded and paid for several apps and now were out that money also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before  theres some wear at the edge of it so i went online to see if i could find this issue and there it is  everywhere this is a problem that has been around for years but android  who is the ultimate culprit has failed to fix it at the source when you plug in the charger theres no click so you know its in place it just slides in and out weve had apple products for several years and never had an issue then the first droid product we purchase cant even be charged from the beginning this will be going back to bestbuy  and will buy another ipad mini  costs more but is much much more reliable,1.0,negative

whats happened to batteries duracell use to be the gold standard until we had over  of them fail by leaking and destroying expensive medical equipment year after year costco batteries became our goto batteries until last year  when they started leaking even on the shelf tried eveready but price and quality varies as well i trusted amazon and love the price packaging convenience and no leaks but they dont last half the time the others have some of the top reviews have stated the electrical case very very well and yes we have some high current draw uses but as my staff and doctors have said to me theyre just batteries get us some decent batteries already we go through dozens a week so price is going to matter but paying top dollar still doesnt seem to save equipment or increase the usage time it seems every manufacture is changing their product for cost and marketing so that you have to be an expert to properly match basic aa batteries to your specific use not cool,1.0,negative
