looking at the picture and seeing it was th generation i assumed it would be a great device i had an original kindle but i stopped using it because it wasnt backlit i thought an th generation would be backlit and the picture makes it look backlit but it is not after  minutes on the phone with amazon trying to make it brighter the technician finally realized that th generation is not supported with backlights i took it back to target and purchased the paperwhite which was more money but definitely worth it the th generation one is smaller so i assumed that was the reason for the price difference target made the experience pleasant,1.0,negative

my initial impression of this was very good the material is nicer than the shiny stuff on my hama cd binders and the netting trim gives a nice appearance compared to plain look of most budget cd bindersthere are  pages with  disc pockets each  per side giving a total of  capacity the pages are hung from the spine in two groups of  by that i mean that  pages all have a single attachment point to the plastic spinethis is where the first problem with this binder lies because each group of  pages shares the same anchor point in the spine the pages cannot sit flat once full of discs they bend and arch and apart from looking tatty this puts a lot of tension across the plastic film with longterm usage i suspect this plastic film will will tear due to the tension it also makes it awkward to browse the binder as the pages dont sit flat it may even crack or bend your discsi look to my hama  binder to see how it should be done  it only has  pages and yet they were smart enough to hang them from the spine in  bundles of  this spreads out the pages and allows easy browsing of the binder without putting any of the pockets under tensionafter just  weeks in storage i opened the binder and the corners of all the pages have become dogeared by themselves this is due to the poor design and poor fit of the binder pages when filled with discs again it is not a problem i have seen with my other disc binders my twoyearold hama binders look as good as newoverally this binder has a lot of storage at a good price if thats all you want you will probably be happy with the product but sloppy design prevents it from being anything more than a mediocre binder i feel that whoever designed this did not bother to fill it with discs to see how it would cope,2.0,negative
i bought these several months ago i use them for xbox one controllers using duracell batteries i get roughly  hours out of  aawith these amazon ones after about  hours i start getting low battery notices and unlike the duracell that i get a few warnings with i only get one shortly before losing all power stick with the name brands i tried these generic ones and regret it,1.0,negative

the reason people give it  stars is because they dont give the product enough time before they review it i purchased this along with my kindle dx on august   i can honestly say that i dont recommend this product as it will damage the kindle the hinge that attaches to the kindle will eventually put pressure on the kindle front plastic cover and soon you will see it crack to avoid this you have to make sure the kindle doesnt rock back and forth from off the back cover causing the hinge to bend more and crack the front plastic further this is hard to do if you open and close your kindle many times a day or simply lend it to someone else who doesnt know better one thing i can honestly say is that i really wanted to like this product i really wanted it to work im looking for a slip cover now,1.0,negative

amazon seems to have changed the manufacturer of this battery i liked it very much the last year but the new one has a different look has noticeably lower capacity and leaks batteries usually leak after they die but these leaked while they were still good and apparently died because of the leak all of my devices have battery monitored one day they were good with  power left and they died suddenly the next day the leaks were mostly minor but clearly noticeable from body discolorationone thing that has not changed from before is the packaging and it is still bad they are shrinkwrapped  in a package and they are hard to open as there is no cutout or pulltab to break the wrap it is difficult to break open by hand twisting the package causes undue stress to the batteries and that may be cause of the leak i have had to use scissors or knife to cut open the package,2.0,negative

i dont want to get too negative on this because it does what its supposed to however im not sure how amazon justifies charging  half that and id feel a lot less disappointed its nothing like the last generation cover which was hefty and substantial that thing could take a beating this one ummnot so muchpros i really like the solution amazon came up with to lock the kindle in place sort of a rubberized cup that grips it on all four sides and holds it very securely no more metalprong sliderelease gizmo it looks quite nice and is genuine if untextured leather like the last onecons flimsy the leather is extremely thin and unpadded wont stand up to much abuse scrape it even lightly on a rough surface and youll likely ruin it the actual cover that folds over the front is incredibly floppy and delicate  its about the thickness of a piece of notepad cardboard i could bend it in half with almost no effort if i had the notion cover has no lockclosure mechanism like the elastic strap on the last gen model it should have somethingoh well it is what it is i never read with the kindle in the case anyway so its not such a big deal to me but i was expecting more especially for this price,2.0,negative

it all depends on what your using a  dollar tablet to do is it for extreme gaming then i highly do not recommend this device it is better for light use on the safe side use for h a day h a day battery is the average but runs down faster and over heats when playing a d game but if u are on tight budget it is useful another major problem is that almost all apps that you would get on iphone and android are not availabe on the amazon fire appstore and there is no way to download them for example clash of clans racing rivals which have decided to withdraw from the amazon contract and delte there game off amazons app stores and other bigger titles omg even snapchat is not on there,2.0,negative

this cover is made for the kindle dx and fits it beautifully the problem  and its a big one  is if you accidentlly try to open the cover from the back which is very easy to do you can damage the kindle without even realizing whats happened my husband did this and cracked the kindle frame within the first week of owning the device fortunately only the frame was cracked and the kindle still works we cannot however remove the cover because of the way it hooks into the device the hook closure must be bent because of the accidental attempt to open the back cover after the incident we attempted to clip the back cover to the kindle but found this to be cumbersome and the clip would not stay in place we are just extremely careful now but the damage was done almost immediately i hope this design flaw has been fixed,1.0,negative

i purchased the amazon fire tv after owning the roku  for a year and after trying both the older and the newest versions and apple tv i am a prime member so this seemed like a perfect choice however the remote is very unresponsive disconnecting more than it stays connected the menu layout is very adcentric and pushes you towards how amazon wants you to view their service when the remote works the amazon tv seems sluggish in comparison to the other products i tried after several hours of fighting with the remote i decided to return it and get another rokupossibly the version  good try amazon but far from being close to either roku or apple tv,1.0,negative

i am extremely disappointed with these batteries which stems not from longevity or power but with fit almost immediately upon receiving them i installed them into three electric candles no joy i cleaned the contacts still no joy i tested the batteries full charge just for grins i installed into one candle three rayovac brand batteries and the candle lit with no problem removed the rayovacs installed the amazons and again no joy i repeated this a couple of times with the same results and i tried this in the other two candles with identical results all three candles lit with the rayovacs none with the amazons knowing the issue was not with candles i took a rayovac and lined it up with an amazon and discovered something interesting the batteries were just a wee bit differentthe length of the positive terminals are different just a tad longer on the rayovac see picture the rayovac terminal is taller longer while the amazon terminal is squattier and therefore shorter the difference in length is tiny no question but when youre putting batteries into a rather cheap device to start with that tiny bit of length in this case seems to be the difference between one battery forming a sufficient connection and the other one not ill keep the amazons to use in devices mice for example that are likely more solidly built than these candles and have a greater connection tolerance or a stronger spring to hold the battery firmly in place i am concluding that when replacing batteries in an older device that may not force as firm a connection or in a cheapo device that may not hold batteries tightly from the getgo use a brandedname batteryi am a longtime and extremely satisfied user of amazon basic computer cables among their first products in the basics line but was recently disappointed with another item i purchased outside of the computer connectors and cables line that being dog housetraining piddle pads which have not proven as absorbent as similarlypriced products and ive bought a lot of different brands the batteries were my second foray into basics product lines outside of the ohsodependablecables arena and now im  for  in the disappointed column i never thought there was a difference in batteries and now i know differently the next time i see a duracell commercial emphasizing reliability and dependability ill think back to this experience as i will when selecting batteries in the future i so wanted to like these amazon batteries too,2.0,negative

very disappointed that my kindle voyage purchased in april failed after just two uses went to charge it tonight to take on a business trip and it wont charge wont reset etc since my best buy receipt says i only have  days to return it tried calling amazon support their only solution after over  minutes on the phone is to process a replacement which may be a new or may be a refurbished device unacceptable to replace a less than month old device with a refurbished one but given the poor experience ive had with the voyage im not even comfortable with a new replacement at this point amazon says they cant do anything about a refund because i purchased from best buy  days seems a little extreme in a situation like this with a defective productstuck with a  paperweight ,1.0,negative

i will never purchase batteries online ever again i should have never believed that this is unique japanese technology that enables better performance after storage overdischarge and high temperatures because frankly it did not even last for two days for my digital clock that has four placements of aaa batteries at first i believed it was a bad batch of a four pack batteries no problem then a week and a half has passed and i had to change the batteries for my clock five times i hope this review will convince you the reader to never purchase these batteries i know they are not that expensive and i shouldnt make a big deal out of it but it is frustrating to see the seller lie more than once took their sweet a time to deliver it to the buyer about a month in waiting and never sent any form of confirmation in purchasing their product well thats that have a good one,1.0,negative

i didnt expect a lot at this price but i also did not expect both of my tablets to be riddled with deadstuck pixels right out of the box i have a third arriving in the mail and am just praying that i am at least good for  waiting on its arrival before doing the trip for returnreplacement just in case that one needs to go as well maybe just bad luck but definitely worth noting for anyone who may also be inconvenienced by having to do a returneverything else seems good though when you can look past the display issues but may be worth waiting until these defective lots have been disbursed and the issues have been correctedi am sure if you dont have these display issues that the product deserves more than  stars but if you can see things from my perspective it is kind of difficult to recommend this to anyone for the time being if the display did not have these pixel issues i could see this easily being a  star recommendation if you do a little research you will see that there are definitely some lot numbers that are more problematic than others so this is not just a rare incident if it is for you and you plan to grab one from a brick and mortar location do yourself a favor and just boot it up before you drive home ,2.0,negative

like dos you need to memorize your command and speak it out otherwise it may not understand your command google assistant is smarter also you cant use spotify free account to work around you must add a lot of free music to amazon music into your own amazon music account before you can hear any music google home is more convenient this case as you can start listening to any music channel by your free account from spotify if you have paid account for spotify then not much different here but to do searching you may be disappointed with this tap google home is just much smarter the sound of this tap is very good indeed but i return it because it cant do music alarm also it cant use spotify for free also its search is not smart enough so i switched to google home,2.0,negative

every single battery leaked battery acid after the first few charges or uses some while in the device it was powering and others while in the charging station i thought perhaps it could be the charging station i was using so i purchased another brand but it didnt make a difference i also never left the batteries in the charger once they were fully charged this happened with the aaa batteries i purchased as well and when i say leaked battery acid im talking about literal puddles of acid that would pool under the charging station or begin leaking from the device i had to throw away a few childrens toys as well as an xbox  controller the skin on the tips of my fingers peeled away a few times as well from overexposure to the battery acid after having to clean so many surfaces and devices from it getting everywhere please dont buy this product they are completely ineffective and its simply an unsafe product all in all purchasing these batteries cost me around  in having to buy replacements for the devices they ruined,1.0,negative

i went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews but my experience was not a good one from the start i was on the phone every day for at least an hour with amazon tech support for one issue or another most of the techs were very polite but not all knew the product very well at one point i asked one of them about trying to save some ram and they kept referring me to the storage which told me they didnt even know the difference between ram and regular storage the internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times even when all my other wifi devices ran great then a day would pass and id be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop workingwtf come to find out its a known issue and theyre working on it after two weeks of one thing after another i got fed up and just returned it i wanted it to work and gave it a good run but just not quality stuff to me it was like walmart trying to build their own computer when theyre obviously not a computer manufacturer neither is amazon if i were you id look at a regular android tablet from a reputable pc manufacturer which is exactly what i did next i got an asus tablet for only a few dollars more and its unbelievable  better in comparison to the amazon fire hd save yourself the aggravation and go with asus or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time sorry amazon not this time,1.0,negative

this is the first amazon product ive purchased i thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really cant be much difference between alkaline batteriesi am a working musician teacher i sing with a band and use a shure wireless beta  mic a normal set of alkaline batteries last about  hours in my mic the first gig i used these with was about   hours with the mic on and by the end of the gig the light on the mic showing battery was showing that the battery was about to die i was just lucky that it lasted long enough for the entire gig usually i can get two full gigs out of an alkaline battery just as a comparison i usually buy the cheapest boxes of batteries at lowes those batteries are only slightly more expensive than the amazon basics and last twice as long in my mici cant say how these batteries work in other things but i can say that for what i use them for they are a big waste of money i would rather use batteries that cost  more and last twice as long,1.0,negative

basically has almost the same content as a roku  would provide but in a much more clunkier menu i can get a better amazon menu layout via the amazon app on the roku  also for those that were hoping to pick up some extra football via fox sports network fs that is not happening you can add the channel free but in order to watch any content you will still need a cable or satellite subscription which defeats the whole purpose of adding the app for us cord cutters there is no way i am signing back up for cable or satellite i wish fs would get with the program and offer a separate subscription such as hbo and showtime do its a thumbs down for me,1.0,negative

i am reading positive reviews and wish i could say the same best buy is great so this is not a reflection on them just our experience with the product we have had this product for just over one month and i have had to contact amazon support perform factory resets to get content to show up and the device is poorly designed as the sd card pops out constantly which messes with drm and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the internet to fix it we are returning and spending the extra money for an ipad will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience if you just use the device for reading maybe this is for you but trying to download information to sd card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating as well as having to do factory resets so content owned already purchased on amazon would show up on the device in the library,1.0,negative

so ive been wanting a fire since they originally came out read some questionable reviews about kindle basic stuff nothing seemed to really discourage me you really dont know what your experience will be unless you try so i got it and began the prime free trial  i was shocked to wake up this morning to find out i had been charged  for a full year of prime one day before my trial was supposed to end no email no contact no are you interested they just charged my card without warning imaginably upset with amazon the tablet it self is so so and is slightly basic the front facing camera is slightly better then the outwards one the alexa feature is kinda nice and fun to talk to it also syncs to other echo devices as well if buying for a teenager or any young adult do set parental controls and or passwords to keep from unauthorized perchues i think the tablet is ok but no great but because of my recent experience i rated it it  stars your ultimately going to make up your own mind and decided if your going to purchase this device and decide if its right for you good luck in your decision,2.0,negative

i got this tablet with high expectations given its from amazon however it was disappointing in many ways and it will be returnedfirst off despite of the small screen size its heavy too heavy to be used as a book reader in bedthe deal breaker for me was that theres no way to connect a vpn using the regular android settings the option has been deactivated and accordingly to the tech support its not available yet but it will come surprisingly still according to them none of the new amazon tables on sale have such support apparently amazon doesnt believe that open wifi at coffee shops supermarkets airports offer data security risks for the tablet userson top of that the amazon version of google play store has a reduced number of apps and the ones i was interested in are not availableand the cherry on the top was that only after  min of small usage i was still trying to find a way to connect to my vpn the screen frozen and the tablet became unresponsivetoo bad i really wanted to like it,2.0,negative
